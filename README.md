# CEGE: Conversational Emotion Graph Evolution

Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) is key to empathetic dialogue systems. Existing models use static graphs or sequences, missing the evolving nature of emotions. **CEGE** introduces a **dynamic temporal graph neural network** that updates utterance representations and influence edges as conversations progress.



## Features

* Dynamic graph evolution with temporal memory.
* CNN utterance encoding + GRU sequential context.
* Attention-based emotion classification.
* Baselines: DialogueRNN, DialogueGCN.
