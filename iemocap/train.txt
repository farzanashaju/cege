Ses01F_impro01_F000	neu	Excuse me.
Ses01F_impro01_M000	fru	Do you have your forms?
Ses01F_impro01_F001	neu	Yeah.
Ses01F_impro01_M001	fru	Let me see them.
Ses01F_impro01_F002	neu	Is there a problem?
Ses01F_impro01_M002	fru	Who told you to get in this line?
Ses01F_impro01_M003	fru	Okay. But I didn't tell you to get in this line if you are filling out this particular form.
Ses01F_impro01_F005	neu	Well what's the problem?  Let me change it.
Ses01F_impro01_M004	fru	This form is a Z.X.four.
Ses01F_impro01_M005	fru	You can't--  This is not the line for Z.X.four.  If you're going to fill out the Z.X.four, you need to have a different form of ID.
Ses01F_impro01_F006	fru	What?  I'm getting an ID.  This is why I'm here.  My wallet was stolen.
Ses01F_impro01_M006	fru	No. I need another set of ID to prove this is actually you.
Ses01F_impro01_F007	fru	How am I supposed to get an ID without an ID?  How does a person get an ID in the first place?
Ses01F_impro01_M007	fru	I don't know.  But I need an ID to pass this form along.  I can't just send it along without an ID.
Ses01F_impro01_F008	fru	I'm here to get an ID.
Ses01F_impro01_M008	fru	No.  I need another ID, a separate one.
Ses01F_impro01_F009	fru	Like what?  Like a birth certificate?
Ses01F_impro01_M009	fru	A birth certificate, a passport...a student ID; didn't you go to school?  Anything?
Ses01F_impro01_F011	fru	Yes but my wallet was stolen, I don't have anything.  I don't have any credit cards, I don't have my ID.  Don't you have things on file here?
Ses01F_impro01_M010	fru	Yeah.  We keep it on file, but we need an ID to access that file.
Ses01F_impro01_F012	ang	That's out of control.
Ses01F_impro01_M011	ang	I don't understand why this is so complicated for people when they get here.  It's just a simple form.  I just need an ID.
Ses01F_impro01_F013	fru	How long have you been working here?
Ses01F_impro01_F014	neu	Clearly.  You know, do you have like a supervisor or something?
Ses01F_impro01_M013	ang	Yeah.  Do you want to see my supervisor?  Huh? Yeah.  Do you want to see my supervisor?  Fine.  I'll be right back.
Ses01F_impro01_F015	fru	That would - I would appreciate that.  Yeah.
Ses01F_impro02_F000	sad	Did you get the mail? So you saw my letter?
Ses01F_impro02_F001	sad	Yeah.  I know.
Ses01F_impro02_M001	sad	I don't understand.  You've already done so much, I don't know why do you have to go back.
Ses01F_impro02_F002	sad	I don't know.  I put in that. request too. They didn't...
Ses01F_impro02_F003	neu	I guess, you know, everybody has to make sacrifices.
Ses01F_impro02_F004	sad	There's people that have given more though, you know?
Ses01F_impro02_M003	fru	I just don't see how they can make you leave when you have a new baby - we have a new kid.
Ses01F_impro02_F005	sad	I know.
Ses01F_impro02_F006	neu	There's babies over there, though, that need mothers.
Ses01F_impro02_M005	sad	I don't know how you can be okay with this?  I don't know why you're not-- you're fine with it.
Ses01F_impro02_F008	sad	Just, you know, kicking myself.
Ses01F_impro02_F010	sad	things just aren't what they seem.
Ses01F_impro02_M008	fru	I know.
Ses01F_impro02_M009	sad	I just don't see why it has to be you.
Ses01F_impro02_F012	sad	If not me then, who?
Ses01F_impro02_M010	sad	What am I going to do? Huh?
Ses01F_impro02_F013	sad	You'll videotape everything, yeah?
Ses01F_impro02_M011	sad	Yeah.
Ses01F_impro02_F014	sad	Maybe you can send it to me, like stream it, yeah?
Ses01F_impro02_M012	neu	Don't you guys have access to computers over there.
Ses01F_impro02_F015	sad	Last month--  Yeah.
Ses01F_impro02_M013	sad	I just don't know how I'm going to do it without you.
Ses01F_impro02_F016	neu	I have to find sitters.
Ses01F_impro02_M014	sad	I can't raise a baby by myself.  How?
Ses01F_impro02_F017	sad	We've got friends, that's why we moved here, huh?  Because there is a day care down the street.
Ses01F_impro02_M015	neu	I know.
Ses01F_impro02_F018	neu	And your mother is close by.
Ses01F_impro02_F019	sad	I'll send you lots of letters.
Ses01F_impro02_F020	sad	And I want lots and lots and lots of pictures.
Ses01F_impro02_M016	fru	It's just not fair.
Ses01F_impro03_M000	neu	So what's up?  What's new?
Ses01F_impro03_F000	hap	Well Vegas was awesome.
Ses01F_impro03_M001	neu	Yeah.  I heard.

Ses01F_impro03_F004	hap	Um- Yes.  It was very romantic.
Ses01F_impro03_F005	hap	It was at the slot machines.
Ses01F_impro03_F006	hap	Uhuh, uhuh.  He won big and he-and he realized that the only thing that would make it better was me as his bride.
Ses01F_impro03_M006	neu	He turned to you and was like...
Ses01F_impro03_M007	hap	[LAUGHTER] That's really romantic.
Ses01F_impro03_F008	hap	Yeah.  Well.  You know, because he's leaving the next day.
Ses01F_impro03_M008	neu	Yeah.
Ses01F_impro03_F009	hap	But we're going to have a honeymoon cruise.
Ses01F_impro03_M009	neu	Does that mean that you're going to get citizenship, too, in- in England or whatever?
Ses01F_impro03_F010	hap	Oh.  I hadn't even thought about that.
Ses01F_impro03_M011	neu	Yeah.  But he'll have like a long visa.  Can you go visit then for a long time?
Ses01F_impro03_F012	hap	Oh.  Totally.
Ses01F_impro03_F013	hap	I guess I'll-  I guess I'll have an internet husband.[LAUGHTER]
Ses01F_impro03_M013	hap	Like you need another one of those.[LAUGHTER]
Ses01F_impro03_M014	hap	Is that your phone?

Ses01F_impro03_F017	neu	Uh, I think seven hundred and fifty dollars.
Ses01F_impro03_F018	neu	Penny slots. That's what he plays.
Ses01F_impro03_F019	neu	Yeah.
Ses01F_impro03_M019	neu	I'm a big fan of the Wheel of Fortune quarters. But it just costs so much.  I don't know.
Ses01F_impro03_F021	hap	Yeah.  We played Wheel of Fortune pennies.  It's like a giant thing with like-
Ses01F_impro03_M020	neu	But the pennies always get you because you end up spending like, you know, fifty bucks.
Ses01F_impro03_F022	neu	Fifty bucks. Mmhmm.
Ses01F_impro03_M021	neu	like, wait, but it's just pennies.  You're like, wait a minute I'm on to you.
Ses01F_impro03_F023	neu	Yeah.
Ses01F_impro03_F024	hap	Well so now we're married. We have cat children.
Ses01F_impro03_M022	exc	Awesome.
Ses01F_impro03_M023	hap	[LAUGHTER] Cat babies.
Ses01F_impro03_F025	hap	We renamed Brenda, Lumber Janet.
Ses01F_impro03_M024	neu	That's fair enough.
Ses01F_impro03_F026	hap	She needs a new name each state that we go into. [LAUGHTER]
Ses01F_impro04_M000	neu	Have you tried, uh, Craig's List?
Ses01F_impro04_F000	neu	Uh, what?  Craig's List?  Oh the internet thing?
Ses01F_impro04_M001	neu	Yeah.
Ses01F_impro04_F001	neu	I don't know.  Isn't that-- that's all like escort services and things like that.
Ses01F_impro04_M002	neu	No.  There's regular jobs on there.
Ses01F_impro04_F002	fru	I don't know.  I mean I've been looking for so long that I just figured that--  I mean, I think things like Monster are a lot more reliable than just some random free board.
Ses01F_impro04_M003	neu	Uh huh.
Ses01F_impro04_M004	neu	I'm just saying I have a friend that got a good job on it so I was just recommending it.
Ses01F_impro04_M005	neu	He's like a manager for a theatre.
Ses01F_impro04_M006	neu	He's like a house manager. Yeah.  It's a good job.
Ses01F_impro04_F005	neu	He just...
Ses01F_impro04_F006	neu	you know what?  I heard about that job.  I applied for that.
Ses01F_impro04_M007	neu	You did?
Ses01F_impro04_F007	fru	Yeah.  I saw a posting at the theatre.
Ses01F_impro04_M008	neu	Yeah.
Ses01F_impro04_M009	neu	You've been looking for a job for a long time; that was a long time ago.  Right?
Ses01F_impro04_F009	neu	Yeah.
Ses01F_impro04_M010	neu	Hmm.
Ses01F_impro04_M011	neu	I don't know.  He had a really good resume I guess and--
Ses01F_impro04_M012	neu	Yeah.  Do you have a resume?
Ses01F_impro04_M013	neu	It's kind of helpful when getting a job.
Ses01F_impro04_F013	neu	I just- I mean I call people up and I tell them what I'm good at.
Ses01F_impro04_M014	neu	Well maybe we should sit down some time and you can just tell me all the stuff that you have done and I'll write it out.
Ses01F_impro04_F014	neu	Yeah.
Ses01F_impro04_M015	neu	No.  You can- or you can just bring it in person.  But they need, generally, something to see, you know, what kind of what that you've done, what kind of--
Ses01F_impro04_F016	fru	I'm there in front of them.  I'm telling them what I'm good at.
Ses01F_impro04_M016	neu	Yeah.  But the piece of paper helps, too.
Ses01F_impro04_F017	fru	Why?  It's a piece of paper.
Ses01F_impro04_M017	neu	No.  But it has an outline, you know.
Ses01F_impro04_F018	fru	I just don't want this paper trail, you know.  I just don't want things following me around, like-.
Ses01F_impro04_M018	neu	I know.  Okay.  Well, um. Maybe--
Ses01F_impro04_F019	fru	It's just-- You know, I've had this problem before.  You're not the first person to tell me that I need a resume but...
Ses01F_impro04_M019	neu	Yeah.
Ses01F_impro04_M020	neu	Okay, yeah.  I would imagine.
Ses01F_impro04_M021	neu	Well, sometimes you have to do things that you don't necessarily like to do to have a job. But the job affords you money, you won't have to be taking the bus right now.
Ses01F_impro04_F021	fru	That's baloney, that's baloney.
Ses01F_impro04_F022	fru	Please.
Ses01F_impro04_M022	neu	maybe get a car.
Ses01F_impro04_M023	neu	I just, you know, think you should try a little harder maybe.
Ses01F_impro04_F023	fru	you think that you're better than me because I don't have a car?
Ses01F_impro04_M024	neu	I didn't say that.
Ses01F_impro04_F024	fru	You know, you're riding the bus, too.
Ses01F_impro04_M025	neu	I am riding the bus, but by choice.
Ses01F_impro04_F025	fru	Why?  What choice?
Ses01F_impro04_M026	neu	To save the environment, carpool.
Ses01F_impro04_F026	fru	You're saving the environment. mmhmm
Ses01F_impro04_M027	neu	Yes.  One less car at a time.
Ses01F_impro04_F027	fru	Interesting.  That's fantastic.
Ses01F_impro04_M028	neu	Mmhmm.
Ses01F_impro04_M029	fru	You know, you don't have to take out your frustration on me, you know, just because...
Ses01F_impro04_F028	ang	I'm not frustrated.
Ses01F_impro04_M030	fru	...you can't get a job and refuse to have a resume.
Ses01F_impro04_F029	ang	Who do you think you are?
Ses01F_impro04_M031	neu	I don't think I'm anyone.
Ses01F_impro04_F030	ang	You are so high and mighty.  I just--
Ses01F_impro04_M032	neu	I- I-I didn't-- okay.
Ses01F_impro04_F031	ang	Oh.  I'm saving the environment. I'm riding this car because I- I want to.
Ses01F_impro04_M034	fru	What? Oh.  So now you're...
Ses01F_impro04_F032	ang	The bus, I'm riding the bus because I want to.
Ses01F_impro04_M035	fru	you know what?  You don't have to take your anger and your hurt out on me.
Ses01F_impro04_F033	ang	I can not-- you are not here by choice.  Nobody would ride this bus by choice.
Ses01F_impro05_F000	fru	Hi.
Ses01F_impro05_M000	neu	Hi.  Thanks for waiting.
Ses01F_impro05_F001	fru	Yeah. This is the fourth line that I have been in.
Ses01F_impro05_M001	hap	Can I help you?
Ses01F_impro05_M002	hap	Uh huh.
Ses01F_impro05_F002	fru	I need my bag.
Ses01F_impro05_M003	neu	Okay.
Ses01F_impro05_F003	fru	I flew in over three hours ago, I've been in four different lines.
Ses01F_impro05_M004	neu	Okay.
Ses01F_impro05_F004	fru	I waited the entire baggage- I waited for the whole baggage carousel four times.  They told me to go to the next one.  I waited through that for three planes and now I'm here.
Ses01F_impro05_M005	neu	Okay.  Great.  I'm really sorry that you had to do that.  What's your last name?  Let's start there.
Ses01F_impro05_F005	fru	Nash.
Ses01F_impro05_M006	neu	Okay.
Ses01F_impro05_M007	neu	all right- okay.  And you lost your bag? Is that- that the issue?
Ses01F_impro05_F007	fru	Yes.
Ses01F_impro05_F008	ang	Flight seven fourteen.
Ses01F_impro05_M008	neu	Uh-huh.
Ses01F_impro05_F009	ang	Am I going to be getting, like, free tickets, free mileage. When can I expect my bag here?
Ses01F_impro05_M009	neu	Yeah. Yeah, I don't see- I don't see any--
Ses01F_impro05_M010	neu	I don't see any record of it, and I-usually when I don't see a record of it, that means um-
Ses01F_impro05_M011	neu	we've mistakenly lost your baggage.  We're very sorry.  On behalf of Jet Blue I would like to apologize for any inconvenience.  I am allowed to issue you a fifty dollar gift card which you can use any future flights you want to take with us.  I'm very sorry, once again...
Ses01F_impro05_M012	neu	for such an inconvenience and your bag, but
Ses01F_impro05_F011	ang	Is this a joke?
Ses01F_impro05_M013	neu	Yeah.
Ses01F_impro05_M014	neu	No, no.
Ses01F_impro05_F012	ang	Are there candid cameras?  Is this that movie? There's that show, right?  Airplane, airline.
Ses01F_impro05_M015	neu	No, no.  This is real.
Ses01F_impro05_M016	neu	No.  I'm just giving you money, the bag is gone.  If it's not here, I'm really sorry there is nothing I can do because...
Ses01F_impro05_M017	neu	this is the only track record that we have and if it's not listed here then it's probably not anywhere.
Ses01F_impro05_F014	ang	You're kidding me, this is a joke.
Ses01F_impro05_F015	ang	Do you have any idea-- fifty dollars?  That's supposed to replace everything that I have?  Do you understand how much I have packed in there? Not only does it have sentimental value; it can't be replaced like that.  It was incredibly expensive.
Ses01F_impro05_M019	neu	Yes.
Ses01F_impro05_M020	neu	I know.
Ses01F_impro05_F016	ang	We flew in from Paris.  I've been shopping for three weeks.
Ses01F_impro05_F017	ang	I don't care what you're freaking sign says.  Somebody- Somebody needs to replace everything I've got there and give me money for my inconvenience.
Ses01F_impro05_M022	neu	Okay. Calm-
Ses01F_impro05_M023	neu	Actually, we are not necessarily liable to give you- to even give you this fifty dollars so... it's actually- it's actually really
Ses01F_impro05_F018	ang	Do you understand who my husband is?
Ses01F_impro05_F019	ang	If you're- if you're- if you're looking for a lawsuit, baby, you've found it.
Ses01F_impro05_M024	neu	We are actually not even allowed--  you know, like we don't have to give you this fifty dollars.  We don't have to do that.
Ses01F_impro05_F020	ang	Oh-Oh.  It's a gift.  You're-You're helping me out here?
Ses01F_impro05_M025	neu	It's a gift.
Ses01F_impro05_M026	neu	You know, the airlines can not be held responsible for every bag of luggage that comes through here.
Ses01F_impro05_F021	ang	You are cruising for a bruising.  You are in so much trouble.
Ses01F_impro05_M027	neu	With the amount of--
Ses01F_impro05_F022	ang	Who's in charge?  Who is the president of Jet Blue?
Ses01F_impro05_M028	neu	Um, actually, I don't know. I don't know. Oh really?
Ses01F_impro05_F023	ang	Because I probably know him.
Ses01F_impro05_F024	ang	Yeah.
Ses01F_impro05_M029	neu	Well then maybe you can just call him and he can give you more money.  But right now all I can do--
Ses01F_impro05_F025	ang	I don't want money, I want my clothes.
Ses01F_impro05_M030	neu	Right now all I can do is just give you this fifty dollars, I'm really sorry.
Ses01F_impro05_F026	ang	What's your name?
Ses01F_impro05_M031	neu	Oh.  My name is Sean. Hi.
Ses01F_impro05_F028	ang	Okay.  I'll do that.
Ses01F_impro05_F029	ang	I don't think you have done everything you could do because I don't have my bag here yet.
Ses01F_impro05_M034	neu	If you want, you can write a letter.  I can give you the address. Yes.  An angry--
Ses01F_impro05_F030	ang	A letter? I'll make a personal phone call.
Ses01F_impro05_M035	neu	Or you can make a phone call.  But I think a letter might be a little more-- in my impression, letters have more...
Ses01F_impro06_M000	sad	I'm sorry, Joy.
Ses01F_impro06_M001	neu	Is there anything I can get you?  Do you want me to take care of anything for you or...?
Ses01F_impro06_M002	neu	...pick up anything?
Ses01F_impro06_F002	sad	No.
Ses01F_impro06_M003	sad	You know you are welcome to stay at my house if you want to just check out for a couple days and hang out.
Ses01F_impro06_F003	neu	That's sweet.
Ses01F_impro06_F004	neu	Thank you.
Ses01F_impro06_F005	sad	I went to see her headstone a week or two ago.
Ses01F_impro06_F006	sad	I used to go to cemeteries a lot before she died.  I just, you know, I felt like they were urban oasis, you know, there is always this green in the city.
Ses01F_impro06_M004	neu	Hmm.
Ses01F_impro06_F007	sad	So I was like wandering around before.  It takes forever to find her headstone; I always lose it. You know.
Ses01F_impro06_F008	sad	So I was looking at this other one and there was like a piece of candy there and I thought that I would take the candy and put it on her headstone.  And-
Ses01F_impro06_F009	neu	this woman came up and, you know, it was hers. It was her person that was there.
Ses01F_impro06_M005	neu	Oh.  She was there?
Ses01F_impro06_F010	sad	Yeah.  And she was like, that's pathetic, I hope you enjoy it.
Ses01F_impro06_F011	sad	And I, you know, I mean, I said I was sorry and I brought it back to her kind of and I like put it on the ground and she was like, no, it's fine.  She was like, I would rather have her back, honestly.
Ses01F_impro06_M006	neu	Mmhmm.
Ses01F_impro06_F012	sad	I don't know.  It just, like, I felt so bad because I shouldn't have done it.  I don't know.  Whatever.
Ses01F_impro06_M007	sad	Yeah.
Ses01F_impro06_F013	sad	I don't know.
Ses01F_impro06_M008	neu	How long were you there for?
Ses01F_impro06_F014	sad	At the cemetery?
Ses01F_impro06_M009	neu	Mmhmm.
Ses01F_impro06_F015	sad	couple hours.
Ses01F_impro06_F016	neu	I brought- I brought Chuck with me. He went to Redlands, yeah, for the day.  We ran through the sprinklers.
Ses01F_impro06_M010	neu	Oh really?
Ses01F_impro06_M011	neu	You ran through the sprinklers in the cemetery?
Ses01F_impro06_M012	neu	Is it a big cemetery?
Ses01F_impro06_F018	neu	Yeah.  It's huge.  Redlands is an old city so they have lots and lots of stones.
Ses01F_impro06_M013	neu	Oh, so they're like really old too, really old ones?
Ses01F_impro06_F019	neu	Yeah.
Ses01F_impro06_F020	sad	It's weird.  Whenever I go back to town, I think of her.  I mean, it's like ... I mean we grew up together and she died when we were twenty one.  And yeah.  She had cancer, she had two brain tumors.
Ses01F_impro06_F021	sad	My best friend Heather.  She's got a- we have a- we built this like little--  There's a park, Prospect Park.  And there is like a garden section of it that we set up for her.
Ses01F_impro06_F022	sad	She used to have these poetry parties on Memorial Day.
Ses01F_impro06_M014	neu	Mmhmm.
Ses01F_impro06_F023	sad	Umm. Yeah.
Ses01F_impro06_F024	sad	And the last time before she died, I remember she couldn't really stand, umm...
Ses01F_impro06_F025	sad	But I mean she could, but it was- so it was kind of sitting at her feet holding her up and she had these poems she had memorized.  And I remember looking up, she had curly red hair and there was this palm tree right behind her and it was like a crown growing right out of her head.  It was cool.
Ses01F_impro06_M015	neu	Mmhmm.
Ses01F_impro06_F026	sad	Some, I guess.  She memorized this one, John Dunn, it's called, Death Be Not Proud. and-
Ses01F_impro06_M016	neu	So she wrote a lot of poetry?
Ses01F_impro06_F027	neu	There's another one, I can't remember.
Ses01F_impro06_F028	sad	I remember, too, when we were--  she died at U.C.L.A.  She had brain surgery and there was not much hope to begin with, but I gave blood for her surgery, her mom and I before, so we dropped her off in the waiting room and then we were giving blood and came back.  And she, in her wheelchair, like can hardly do anything, reciting her poetry for these people like in the waiting room.  All she needs is a God damn audience.  You know?
Ses01F_impro07_M000	exc	Did you get the letter?
Ses01F_impro07_F000	exc	Yes.  There's a big envelope it says, you're in. I know.
Ses01F_impro07_M001	exc	Yeah. That is so awesome.
Ses01F_impro07_M002	exc	Oh my God. What are you going to do? [LAUGHTER]
Ses01F_impro07_M003	exc	Oh-Yeah, I bet you're really excited. Oh.  That's what loans are for?  Right? Exactly.
Ses01F_impro07_F002	exc	I'm really excited.  Yeah. I don't know how I'm going to pay for anything, but... I also- Yeah.  Loans, too, yeah. I applied, though, for a bunch of grants and scholarships so I'm still waiting to hear on that.
Ses01F_impro07_M004	exc	Oh.  Good, good.  That's awesome. Are you going to stay around here?  Or are you going to like get a different neighborhood- you going to move to a different neighborhood?
Ses01F_impro07_F003	exc	Oh- I know, I know, I know, I know.
Ses01F_impro07_F004	exc	I don't know.  I spend so much time commuting as it is, I'd rather.
Ses01F_impro07_M005	exc	This is so- I am so happy that you're going to stay.  You're not going to...We should totally throw a party.
Ses01F_impro07_F005	exc	I know. We should throw a party.
Ses01F_impro07_M006	exc	A rapper party ho. Yeah. Okay.
Ses01F_impro07_M007	exc	I am just- Yeah.  I'm sticking around, I'm just doing my thing.  I'm living here.  I'm so glad you're going to stay, I'm so glad you're going to be here. Yeah. Woo.
Ses01F_impro07_M008	exc	Yeah.  Big time.
Ses01F_impro07_M009	exc	Mmhmm. Mmhmm. Yay. So what major?  What are you doing?
Ses01F_impro07_F009	exc	Yeah.  I'm not sure.
Ses01F_impro07_M012	neu	Is this a Masters or a P.h.D.?  Or can you...? Nice
Ses01F_impro07_F010	exc	Umm...P.h.D. [LAUGHTER]
Ses01F_impro07_M013	neu	That's good.  Don't you have to like teach a class, too, when you do that?
Ses01F_impro07_M014	exc	Teacher. Mrs. Nash, I have a question.
Ses01F_impro07_F012	exc	So I get to mold young minds. Mrs.?  That's my mother.
Ses01F_impro07_M015	exc	You have to get married.  Well you are married to Chuck.  You're Mrs. Nash.  Not to be confused with Mrs. Dash which is the popular seasoning.
Ses01F_impro07_F013	exc	I would be like- Oh. Right, right, right.
Ses01F_impro07_M017	exc	Yay...School's fun.
Ses01F_impro07_M018	neu	Of course, right.  That's where the real money is, being a student.
Ses01F_impro07_M019	hap	That's how you get the big bucks.  Are you messing with the chair? Don't ruin it.
Ses01F_impro07_F016	exc	I know. I made such a mess of it, the entire time.  The last three things I've done, I've ruined everything, I think. Mm-hmm.  Yeah.
Ses01F_script01_1_F000	fru	What's he going to say?
Ses01F_script01_1_M000	neu	He saw it.
Ses01F_script01_1_M001	neu	He was out here when it broke.
Ses01F_script01_1_M002	neu	Four o clock this morning.  I heard a crack and I woke up and looked out.  He was standing right over there when it cracked.
Ses01F_script01_1_M003	neu	I don't know.
Ses01F_script01_1_F005	neu	He's dreaming of him again, walking around.
Ses01F_script01_1_M004	neu	I guess he is.
Ses01F_script01_1_M005	fru	I don't know the meaning of it.  But I know one thing, Mom, you've made a terrible mistake with father.
Ses01F_script01_1_M007	neu	You know Larry is not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?
Ses01F_script01_1_F009	fru	What do you want to do?  Argue with him?
Ses01F_script01_1_M008	fru	I don't want to argue but it's time he realized that nobody believes Larry is alive.
Ses01F_script01_1_M009	fru	You know?  Why shouldn't he walk the nights thinking of him, dreaming of him?   Do we contradict him?  Do we say, we don't have any hope anymore?  That we haven't had any hope for years now?
Ses01F_script01_1_F010	fru	You can't say that to him.
Ses01F_script01_1_M010	neu	We've got to say it to him.
Ses01F_script01_1_F011	fru	Where's the proof?  Do you have any proof?
Ses01F_script01_1_M011	fru	For God's sake, three years?  Nobody comes back after three years; that's insane.
Ses01F_script01_1_F012	fru	To you it is, to me it is, but to your father, you can talk yourself until you are blue in the face.  But there is no grave and there is no body, so where are you?
Ses01F_script01_1_M012	neu	Sit down, Mom.  I want to talk to you.
Ses01F_script01_1_M013	fru	All right, all right, all right.  You know why I asked Annie here, right?
Ses01F_script01_1_F014	fru	Why?
Ses01F_script01_1_M014	neu	You know.
Ses01F_script01_1_F015	neu	Well I got an idea, but what's your story?
Ses01F_script01_1_M015	neu	I'm going to ask her to marry me.
Ses01F_script01_1_M016	neu	You know it's not just my business.
Ses01F_script01_1_M017	neu	So all right then, I'll just go ahead with it?
Ses01F_script01_1_M018	fru	Then it's not just my business.
Ses01F_script01_1_M019	ang	You know sometimes you infuriate me.  you know that?  Isn't it your business if I tell father and he throws a fit about it?  God, you have such a talent for ignoring things.
Ses01F_script01_1_M020	fru	She's not Larry's girl.
Ses01F_script01_1_F021	fru	From your father's point of view, he is not dead and- Chris he still thinks he's still alive.  The girl is Larry's girl.
Ses01F_script01_1_F022	fru	Now you can go on from there if you know where to go, but I'm telling you, I don't know where to go.
Ses01F_script01_1_M021	fru	I don't know why it is, but every time I reach out for something I have to pull back because I am afraid other people will suffer. My whole bloody life, time after time.
Ses01F_script01_1_F023	fru	You're a considerate fellow, there's nothing wrong in that.
Ses01F_script01_1_M022	fru	To hell with that.
Ses01F_script01_1_F024	fru	I just don't see why.  Have you asked Annie yet?
Ses01F_script01_1_M023	neu	I wanted to get this settled first.
Ses01F_script01_1_F025	fru	Well how do you know she's going to marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way your father does.
Ses01F_script01_1_M024	neu	Well if she does, then that's it.  That's the end of it.  From her letters, though, I think she's pretty much forgotten him.
Ses01F_script01_1_M025	neu	And then we'll thrash it out with father.  Okay Mom?  Don't avoid me.
Ses01F_script01_1_F026	fru	The trouble is you don't see enough women.  You never did.
Ses01F_script01_1_M026	fru	So what.  I'm not fast with women.
Ses01F_script01_1_F027	fru	Why does it have to be Annie?
Ses01F_script01_1_M027	fru	Because it is.
Ses01F_script01_1_F028	fru	Oh that's a great reason.  It's no reason at all.
Ses01F_script01_1_M028	fru	I don't know.
Ses01F_script01_1_F029	fru	You haven't seen her since you went away to war, it's been five years.
Ses01F_script01_1_M029	fru	I can't help it, I know her best.  I was brought up next door to her, you know?  These years when I think of someone for my wife, I think of Annie.
Ses01F_script01_1_M030	fru	Mom, what do you want?  A diagram?
Ses01F_script01_1_F030	fru	I don't want a diagram.
Ses01F_script01_1_F031	fru	He thinks he's coming back Chris.
Ses01F_script01_1_F032	fru	You marry that girl, you are pronouncing him dead...
Ses01F_script01_1_F033	fru	...and then what's that going to do to your father?  Do you know?  I don't.
Ses01F_script01_1_M031	fru	All right, then, Mom. [BREATHING]
Ses01F_script01_1_F034	neu	Just give it some more thought.
Ses01F_script01_1_M032	fru	I've given it three years of thought.  And I'd hope that if I waited, father would forget about Larry and then we could just have a regular wedding and everyone would be happy.
Ses01F_script01_1_M033	fru	But if I can't do that here, I may have to go somewhere else.
Ses01F_script01_1_F035	ang	What the hell is this?
Ses01F_script01_1_M034	neu	I'll get out.  I'll get married and I'll move somewhere else, maybe New York.
Ses01F_script01_1_M035	fru	I've been a good son for too long, a good sucker.
Ses01F_script01_1_F037	ang	You have a business here.  What the hell is this?
Ses01F_script01_1_M036	fru	The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.
Ses01F_script01_1_F038	ang	Oh.  Must you be inspired?
Ses01F_script01_1_M037	fru	Yes.  I like it for an hour a day.  I don't care if I have to grub for money all day long, when I come home I want it happy.
Ses01F_script01_1_M038	fru	I want some kids, I want a family, I want somebody that I can give myself to and Annie is in the center of that.  Now it's just where to find it.
Ses01F_script01_1_F039	fru	You mean to tell me that you would leave the business over this?
Ses01F_script01_1_M039	neu	On this, I would.
Ses01F_script01_1_F040	fru	Well you don't want to think like that.
Ses01F_script01_1_M040	neu	Then help me stay here.
Ses01F_script01_1_F041	ang	All right.  But you don't want to think like that because what the hell are we working for, Chris?  It's all for you.  This whole shooting match is for you.
Ses01F_script01_1_M041	fru	I know that.  Then just help me stay here.
Ses01F_script01_1_F042	ang	Just don't think like that.
Ses01F_script01_1_M042	fru	Well I am thinking like that.
Ses01F_script01_1_F043	fru	I don't understand you, do I?
Ses01F_script01_1_M043	fru	No.  You don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.
Ses01F_script01_1_F044	fru	I can see that.
Ses01F_script01_2_M001	neu	Well maybe...maybe he just wanted to see her.
Ses01F_script01_2_M003	fru	[BREATHING] You don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anything more than he told you.
Ses01F_script01_2_F003	ang	He's not going to marry her.
Ses01F_script01_2_M004	neu	How do you know he's even thinking about it?
Ses01F_script01_2_F004	ang	It's got that about it.
Ses01F_script01_2_F005	ang	What is going on here, Joe?
Ses01F_script01_2_M006	fru	Now listen.
Ses01F_script01_2_F006	ang	She is not his girl.  She knows she's not.
Ses01F_script01_2_M007	fru	You can't read her mind.
Ses01F_script01_2_F007	ang	Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men, why is she still single?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she waited.
Ses01F_script01_2_M008	neu	How do you know why she waited?
Ses01F_script01_2_F008	ang	Because she knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my darkest moments, I think of her waiting and I know that I'm right.
Ses01F_script01_2_M009	fru	Hey look, it's a nice day, huh?  Why are we arguing?
Ses01F_script01_2_F009	ang	Nobody in this house dares take away her faith, Joe.  You know strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.
Ses01F_script01_2_M010	fru	What do you want me to do? What do you want?
Ses01F_script01_2_F010	ang	I want you to-- I want you to act like he is coming back, both of you.  Don't think I haven't noticed you since Chris invited her here.
Ses01F_script01_2_F011	ang	I won't stand for any nonsense.
Ses01F_script01_2_M011	fru	Kate.
Ses01F_script01_2_F012	ang	Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.  Oh laugh, laugh all you like but why does this happen the very night he comes back.  She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look at it, Joe, look.
Ses01F_script01_2_M012	fru	[BREATHING]
Ses01F_script01_2_M013	fru	Calm yourself.
Ses01F_script01_2_F013	ang	Just believe with me, Joe. Only last week a man came back in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  Believe with me. You, above all, have got to believe. Just believe.
Ses01F_script01_2_M014	fru	Okay. Calm yourself.
Ses01F_script01_2_M015	fru	I know. All right, all right. All right. Okay.  Calm yourself. What does that mean, me above all?
Ses01F_script01_2_F014	fru	I can't help it.
Ses01F_script01_2_M017	ang	What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?
Ses01F_script01_3_F000	neu	You're the only one who still loves his parents.
Ses01F_script01_3_M000	neu	I know.  It kind of went out of style, didn't it?
Ses01F_script01_3_F001	neu	It's not so bad; it's a good thing.
Ses01F_script01_3_F002	neu	[BREATHING] You know, it's lovely here.  The air is sweet.
Ses01F_script01_3_M001	neu	You're not sorry you came.
Ses01F_script01_3_F003	neu	I'm not sorry, no. But I'm...I can't stay.
Ses01F_script01_3_F004	neu	For one thing, your mother much as told me to go.
Ses01F_script01_3_M003	neu	Well.
Ses01F_script01_3_F005	neu	And then, you.  You've been kind of...
Ses01F_script01_3_M004	neu	What?
Ses01F_script01_3_F006	neu	Sort of embarrassed ever since I got here.
Ses01F_script01_3_M005	neu	Well I was kind of planning of sneaking up on you over the course of a week or so.  They just take it for granted that we're all set.
Ses01F_script01_3_F007	neu	I knew they would.
Ses01F_script01_3_F008	neu	Well sure, from your mother's point of view.  Why else would I come?
Ses01F_script01_3_F009	neu	I, umm. I guess, I guess that's kind of why I came.
Ses01F_script01_3_F010	hap	[BREATHING]
Ses01F_script01_3_M008	hap	I love you. Annie, I love you.
Ses01F_script01_3_F011	hap	[LAUGHTER]
Ses01F_script01_3_M009	hap	I don't really have any imagination, that's all I know how to say.
Ses01F_script01_3_F012	hap	[LAUGHTER]
Ses01F_script01_3_M010	hap	Am I embarrassing you? Are you - See, I didn't want to do it here with this yard, on this porch.  I wanted it to be somewhere new, some place fresh for both of us.
Ses01F_script01_3_F013	hap	No. No
Ses01F_script01_3_F014	neu	Chris, I've been ready a long, long, time.
Ses01F_script01_3_F015	neu	I almost got married two years ago.
Ses01F_script01_3_F016	neu	You started to write me.
Ses01F_script01_3_F017	hap	Every day since.
Ses01F_script01_3_M015	hap	Why didn't you let me know?
Ses01F_script01_3_M016	hap	Give me a...
Ses01F_script01_3_M017	hap	Give me a kiss.
Ses01F_script01_3_F019	hap	beating around the bush.
Ses01F_script01_3_F020	hap	I will never forgive you.  All I'd done was sit around wondering if I was crazy waiting so long, wondering if you were thinking about me.
Ses01F_script01_3_M019	hap	Oh Annie, we are going to live now.  I am going to make you so happy.
Ses01F_script01_3_F021	hap	Not like that you're not.
Ses01F_script01_3_M020	hap	I kissed you.
Ses01F_script01_3_F022	neu	Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.
Ses01F_script01_3_M021	sad	Hey, let's drive some place.  Huh?  Let's get out of here.
Ses01F_script01_3_M022	sad	No it's nothing like that. It's-
Ses01F_script01_3_M023	sad	Yeah.  I suppose I have been. But it's going from me.
Ses01F_script01_3_M024	sad	I don't even know how to start.
Ses01F_script01_3_M025	sad	It's just all mixed up with so many other things, you know?  You know overseas I was in command of a company?
Ses01F_script01_3_F028	neu	Yeah, sure.
Ses01F_script01_3_M026	sad	Well I lost them.
Ses01F_script01_3_F029	neu	How many?
Ses01F_script01_3_M027	sad	Pretty much all.
Ses01F_script01_3_F030	sad	Aw, geez.
Ses01F_script01_3_M028	sad	You can't just toss off a thing like that because they weren't just men. You know?
Ses01F_script01_3_M029	sad	Like for instance, there was this one time it had been raining for several days and this kid he just came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks.  He just put them in my pocket.  That's a little thing, you know, but that's what kind of guys I had.
Ses01F_script01_3_M030	sad	They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that, exactly.  Just a little more selfish and they would all be here today.
Ses01F_script01_3_F031	neu	Mmhmm.
Ses01F_script01_3_M032	sad	To bring that on to the earth again, you know, is like some kind of monument and I thought I would just make a difference to them.
Ses01F_script01_3_M033	sad	But then I came home and it was incredible, you know?  The whole thing was just kind of this random bus accident.  You know, I went back to the rat race again, I went to work.
Ses01F_script01_3_M036	sad	And I didn't want any of it. I guess that included you.
Ses01F_script01_3_M037	neu	I just want you to know Annie.
Ses01F_script01_3_F035	hap	What would I do with a fortune?
Ses01F_script02_1_F000	neu	Fine.
Ses01F_script02_1_M002	exc	Okay.  Is that, is that--
Ses01F_script02_1_F001	fru	[BREATHING]
Ses01F_script02_1_M007	neu	The flashlight, the silver one.  There's only one, isn't there?
Ses01F_script02_1_F004	neu	That's not your flashlight.
Ses01F_script02_1_M008	neu	Whose is it?
Ses01F_script02_1_M009	neu	Oh...well. Yeah, of course.
Ses01F_script02_1_F006	ang	You keep saying my flashlight like it's just yours.
Ses01F_script02_1_M010	neu	No.
Ses01F_script02_1_F007	ang	How's that supposed to make me feel?
Ses01F_script02_1_M011	neu	Of course, our flashlight.  What's yours is mine.  Me flashlight es su flashlight.
Ses01F_script02_1_M012	fru	Naturally.  God, how could we not think to bring it?  I hope the moon stays out, though.
Ses01F_script02_1_M013	neu	Do they always run during a full moon?  I don't remember.  Was it full last year?
Ses01F_script02_1_F008	neu	Yeah.
Ses01F_script02_1_M014	neu	Huh.  Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  No?  you know, we should have brought the blanket?  Our blanket.
Ses01F_script02_1_M015	neu	Aw.  Do you know, I should have brought a six pack, too.  A six pack, that would be just the ticket right about now.  Huh?
Ses01F_script02_1_M016	exc	God, I'm so excited, I'm like a kid.  I can't believe I got out of the house with my fly zipped up.
Ses01F_script02_1_F009	hap	[LAUGHTER]
Ses01F_script02_1_F010	sad	I'm cold.
Ses01F_script02_1_M018	fru	Do you want my jacket?
Ses01F_script02_1_M020	neu	Right.
Ses01F_script02_1_M021	neu	Wait, that's my point, too.
Ses01F_script02_1_F014	fru	Well, then let's go.
Ses01F_script02_1_M022	fru	No, no.  Okay.  That's not my point.  My point is there is no point in coming down here if we just turn around and go home.  Don't you want to see it?
Ses01F_script02_1_F015	neu	Not particularly.
Ses01F_script02_1_M023	neu	Why not?
Ses01F_script02_1_M024	neu	Honey, this is like a natural phenomenon. I mean... People in Kansas would have to get plane reservations and get hotel rooms to see this.  It's just forty minutes away for us; it's too good to pass up.
Ses01F_script02_1_F017	fru	Pass what up?  I mean these fish swim out of the ocean, they flop around on the beach, they swim away and then they die.
Ses01F_script02_1_M025	neu	Yeah.  But this..this moment on the beach is like the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping around is laying eggs or what to do - spawning or mating or whatever.
Ses01F_script02_1_M026	neu	This is a big night for these little guys.  It's like life's last orgy.
Ses01F_script02_1_M027	fru	Yeah they do.
Ses01F_script02_1_F019	fru	Oh Augie
Ses01F_script02_1_M029	neu	There's like mystery here, there's magic.  It's like a little bit of the unexplainable.  I just can't see how you're not interested.
Ses01F_script02_1_F021	fru	Yeah.
Ses01F_script02_1_M031	neu	God, I don't get it.  you know the first time we came here, you said it was the best night of your life?
Ses01F_script02_1_M032	neu	And last year, I remember distinctly you said, you were so excited to get here that you don't remember you stubbed your toe until we were in the car.
Ses01F_script02_1_M033	neu	Ahh...we weren't in a good spot.
Ses01F_script02_1_F023	fru	Hmm.  We didn't see them the year before either.
Ses01F_script02_1_M034	neu	We just weren't in a good spot.  I'm telling you, this is a much better spot.  I have instincts for these things.
Ses01F_script02_1_M035	exc	Look there, see?  What's that?  No, that's - that's just seaweed.
Ses01F_script02_1_M036	hap	God, this is great.  Think about this.  I know you are not interested, but just think about this.
Ses01F_script02_1_M038	exc	Just all at once, they turned and they formed this line as long as the California coast.  And some instinctual little firecracker went off in their bodies and they all just turned as one and started swimming.
Ses01F_script02_1_M040	exc	It's single mindedness with no mind.  It is urgency that is just pure urge.
Ses01F_script02_1_F024	neu	That's the wind.
Ses01F_script02_1_M043	hap	So what do you think?
Ses01F_script02_1_F025	neu	About what?
Ses01F_script02_2_M000	exc	Look at this, all of the hairs are standing up on my arm.
Ses01F_script02_2_F000	neu	That's the wind.
Ses01F_script02_2_M001	exc	Well, so, what do you think?
Ses01F_script02_2_F001	neu	About what?
Ses01F_script02_2_M002	neu	About what I was saying.
Ses01F_script02_2_M004	fru	Not just me, look at all of these people.
Ses01F_script02_2_M006	neu	Carla, can I ask you something?  Now, don't take this the wrong way, but are you on your period?
Ses01F_script02_2_F006	ang	Don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that, you always ask me that.  It's insulting.
Ses01F_script02_2_M007	fru	Well then, what's bugging you?
Ses01F_script02_2_F007	fru	We just have different ideas of what this night is supposed to look like.
Ses01F_script02_2_M008	fru	There is nothing to it; we come down here, the fish arrive, they flop around, they do their fish thing.  We go ooh, ah, look at the fish and we go home.
Ses01F_script02_2_F008	ang	For God- Grow up, Augie.  The fish are not going to arrive.
Ses01F_script02_2_M009	fru	Why not?
Ses01F_script02_2_F009	ang	Because they never do.  Have they...Have they ever?
Ses01F_script02_2_M010	fru	We've missed them twice.
Ses01F_script02_2_F010	ang	Twice is every time we have tried; that's ever.
Ses01F_script02_2_M011	fru	They'll show up this time.
Ses01F_script02_2_F012	fru	I feel like my whole life is going to be spent standing on this beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for fish to show up.  And the fish never show up.
Ses01F_script02_2_F013	fru	You don't understand anything I am saying.
Ses01F_script02_2_M013	fru	No. Of course not.
Ses01F_script02_2_F015	sad	I feel like I'm always just standing here waiting.  I feel like this night is going to be the night, but it never is.
Ses01F_script02_2_M014	fru	It's just fish, it's nothing to get traumatized over.
Ses01F_script02_2_F016	ang	For God's sake, this is not about fish.
Ses01F_script02_2_M015	fru	Okay.  I'm trying to work this backwards and pinpoint the exact moment where we took a turn for the worst here.
Ses01F_script02_2_M016	neu	Okay.  So you were fine during that phone call from Marge and then dinner was okay.  And doing the dishes was fine and then I was going to take a shower and you're watching the news and you said the grunions are running tonight, do you want to go?  And I said, sure great, let's go.
Ses01F_script02_2_M017	neu	Okay.  So I am putting out the pets, getting the car out of the garage.
Ses01F_script02_2_F017	neu	Do you remember the first year we came here?  It was like four years after we got married.
Ses01F_script02_2_F019	hap	You whispered the sweetest, most intimate things to me right into my ear so I could feel them as much as hear them.  And I remember thinking, this is it.  You know, finally, I am as happy as I'm supposed to be.
Ses01F_script02_2_M019	neu	It's when we were driving past that Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, let's get some champagne.  I said no, time's a wasting or something like that.
Ses01F_script02_2_F021	fru	dancing barefoot in the sand.
Ses01F_script02_2_M020	fru	That's what it is?  Right?  You want this to be like the other time, right?
Ses01F_script02_2_F022	sad	I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things.
Ses01F_script02_2_M021	neu	Sure.  All right.  Okay.
Ses01F_script02_2_M022	neu	Listen, do you want to dance?
Ses01F_script02_2_F023	neu	No.
Ses01F_script02_2_M023	neu	Do you want me to go get some champagne?
Ses01F_script02_2_M024	hap	Do you want to take off your shoes?
Ses01F_script02_2_F025	fru	No, no. Nothing.
Ses01F_script02_2_M026	hap	Do you want to get married again?
Ses01F_script02_2_F026	neu	No.
Ses01F_script02_2_F027	fru	No.
Ses01F_script02_2_F029	fru	[BREATHING]
Ses01F_script02_2_M031	fru	No I'm just like you.  I thought it was going to be all roses and peaches and the bills would just pay themselves.  And we'll have three, fat rosy cheeked children.  Huh, baby, the joke's on us.  Because you know what you get?
Ses01F_script02_2_M032	fru	Do you know what you get?  You get this.
Ses01F_script02_2_F030	fru	This? What is this?  This is nothing.  This isn't even anything.
Ses01F_script02_2_M033	neu	Yes it is.
Ses01F_script02_2_F032	fru	I mean this is a lot of things, but it's just...
Ses01F_script02_2_M035	fru	[BREATHING]
Ses01F_script02_2_F033	fru	Do you understand what I am saying?
Ses01F_script02_2_M036	fru	I'm doing the best I can.
Ses01F_script02_2_F034	sad	I know you are Augie, I know.
Ses01F_script02_2_F035	sad	I know you meant this to be special, I know that you wanted it to be right, but I just can't help thinking that, I can't help wishing that I was somewhere else.
Ses01F_script02_2_M037	sad	Maybe if you were with someone else, too.
Ses01F_script02_2_F036	sad	I didn't say that.
Ses01F_script02_2_M038	sad	I just- I know I don't make you happy.
Ses01F_script02_2_F040	sad	You're the one who probably wishes he was with somebody else.  Somebody who doesn't take things so seriously, who could enjoy herself.
Ses01F_script02_2_M040	neu	You know, actually now that you mention it, no I don't.
Ses01F_script02_2_F041	neu	So maybe we are in the wrong spot, but we are with the right person.
Ses01F_script02_2_M041	fru	I don't know, it seemed like such a good spot to me.
Ses01F_script02_2_M042	neu	We have a great view of the moon from here, though, huh?
Ses01F_script02_2_F042	hap	Hmm.  I noticed that, it's pretty. Big old white moon.
Ses01F_script02_2_M043	neu	[BREATHING]
Ses01F_script02_2_M044	hap	And look what I got here.
Ses01F_script02_2_F043	hap	Augie, you bought refreshments.
Ses01F_script02_2_F044	hap	I guess we don't need glasses.
Ses01F_script02_2_M046	hap	[BREATHING]
Ses01F_script02_2_M047	neu	Do you want to go home?  Are you cold?
Ses01F_script02_2_F045	hap	I'm beginning to think this might be the right spot after all.
Ses01F_script02_2_F046	sad	Augie, I'm sorry.
Ses01F_script02_2_M048	neu	Shh.  If we're very quiet, the fish might come.
Ses01F_script02_2_F047	neu	Or not.
Ses01F_script02_2_M049	hap	Or not.
Ses01F_script03_1_M005	exc	I don't care then.
Ses01F_script03_1_M007	hap	No.  Wrong number. [LAUGHTER]
Ses01F_script03_1_F005	hap	[LAUGHTER] That sent shivers up my spine.
Ses01F_script03_1_M008	hap	What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us.[LAUGHTER]
Ses01F_script03_1_F006	exc	We'll behave exquisitely.
Ses01F_script03_1_M009	hap	With perfect poise.
Ses01F_script03_1_F007	exc	I think I shall do a curtsy.
Ses01F_script03_1_M010	hap	It's strange; things that ought to matter dreadfully, they just don't matter at all when one's happy.  Do they?
Ses01F_script03_1_F010	hap	Yes.  Meaning just that.
Ses01F_script03_1_M013	hap	Well what does it all mean?  That's what I ask myself in my quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean?
Ses01F_script03_1_F011	hap	Don't laugh at me.  I'm being serious.
Ses01F_script03_1_F012	exc	Who's they?
Ses01F_script03_1_M018	hap	Who knows?
Ses01F_script03_1_M021	exc	Yes.  Yes with all of his might.
Ses01F_script03_1_M024	exc	Let's be superficial, and just pity those poor philosophers, huh?  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party for as long as we can, you know, like small, idiotic school children.
Ses01F_script03_1_F020	hap	[LAUGHTER]
Ses01F_script03_1_M025	hap	Oh Come and kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop out of your eye sockets.
Ses01F_script03_1_F021	hap	Oh Elliott, worms don't pop.
Ses01F_script03_1_M026	hap	Oh See, I don't care what you do, see.  You can paint yourself green and run naked through the Place Vendome and run off with all of the men of the world.  I shan't say a word, just as long as you love me best.
Ses01F_script03_1_F022	hap	Aw.  Thank you, darling.  The same applies to you too, except that if you so much as look at another woman I'll kill you.
Ses01F_script03_1_F024	exc	Oh Charles, that was his name.  He did wiggle so beautifully.
Ses01F_script03_1_M034	hap	That was a rouser, wasn't it?
Ses01F_script03_1_F029	hap	The manager came in, he found us rolling about the floor, biting and scratching like panthers. [LAUGHTER]  How utterly, utterly ridiculous.
Ses01F_script03_1_M036	hap	[LAUGHTER] I'll never forget his face. [LAUGHTER]
Ses01F_script03_1_M037	hap	[LAUGHTER] We were very much younger then.
Ses01F_script03_1_F030	hap	[LAUGHTER] And very much sillier.
Ses01F_script03_2_F000	hap	And very much sillier.
Ses01F_script03_2_M001	neu	However I believe the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.
Ses01F_script03_2_F001	hap	Oh.  You knew there was nothing in that.
Ses01F_script03_2_M002	neu	I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.
Ses01F_script03_2_F002	hap	Presents?  It was only a trivial, little brooch.
Ses01F_script03_2_M004	neu	You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.
Ses01F_script03_2_F004	neu	I did not.  You worked that whole thing up in your jealous imagination.
Ses01F_script03_2_M005	fru	Well, you let him kiss you, huh?  You said you did.
Ses01F_script03_2_F005	neu	Well, what of it?
Ses01F_script03_2_M007	ang	What about me?
Ses01F_script03_2_F008	fru	Oh dear.  I'm bored with this conversation.
Ses01F_script03_2_M009	fru	So am I.  I'm bored stiff. [GARBAGE]  Do you want some brandy?
Ses01F_script03_2_M010	neu	I'll have a little, I think.
Ses01F_script03_2_M011	neu	No particular reason.  Anyhow, they are very small ones.
Ses01F_script03_2_M012	fru	You can hardly call three glasses of liquor a whole evening long, going on and on and on.
Ses01F_script03_2_M013	fru	Oh.  Don't be so grand.  Just because you don't happen to want one at the moment.
Ses01F_script03_2_F013	ang	Don't be stupid.
Ses01F_script03_2_M014	ang	Really, Amanda.
Ses01F_script03_2_F014	ang	What?
Ses01F_script03_2_M015	fru	Nothing.
Ses01F_script03_2_M016	neu	you going out somewhere, dear?
Ses01F_script03_2_F015	ang	No.  I am just making myself fascinating for you.
Ses01F_script03_2_F016	ang	Oh.  It's a woman's duty to allure the man.
Ses01F_script03_2_M018	neu	Well as a matter of fact, yes, that's perfectly true.
Ses01F_script03_2_F017	ang	No it isn't.
Ses01F_script03_2_M019	neu	Yes it is.
Ses01F_script03_2_F018	ang	You shut up.
Ses01F_script03_2_M020	ang	Oh really.  It's a pity you didn't have any brandy, it would have made you a little less disagreeable.
Ses01F_script03_2_M021	ang	Snap, snap, snap.  You know you are like a little adder.
Ses01F_script03_2_M022	ang	Nonsense.  They have a bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap. They snap.
Ses01F_script03_2_F021	ang	They sting. I don't care.  Do you understand?  I don't care if they bark and they roll about like hoops.
Ses01F_script03_2_M023	ang	Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?
Ses01F_script03_2_F022	ang	Yes I did, quite a lot.
Ses01F_script03_2_M024	ang	And I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more than, too. Yes.  I suppose you guys had a riotous time, huh?  All out, no restraint at all.  Well, you never really had much anyhow.
Ses01F_script03_2_F023	ang	Mind your own business.
Ses01F_script03_2_F024	ang	You're quite insufferable, I expect it's because you are drunk.
Ses01F_script03_2_M025	ang	I think I am not in the least bit drunk.
Ses01F_script03_2_F025	ang	You've always had a weak head.
Ses01F_script03_2_M026	ang	I think I mentioned once before that I've had three minute liquor glasses the whole evening long.  A child of two cannot get drunk on that.
Ses01F_script03_2_F026	ang	On the contrary, a child of two can get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.
Ses01F_script03_2_M027	ang	That's very interesting Amanda. How about a child of four?  Or a child of six?  Or a child of nine? We can get a good little conversation going on about this, you know, intemperate tots.
Ses01F_script03_2_F027	ang	Oh shut up.
Ses01F_script03_2_F028	ang	Shut up.
Ses01F_script03_2_F029	ang	Not very funny, darling.  Why don't you have some more brandy.
Ses01F_script03_2_M029	ang	Look, you better turn that off. I don't want to wake up the people upstairs.
Ses01F_script03_2_F030	neu	Why?
Ses01F_script03_2_F031	neu	There are no people upstairs; it's a photographer's studio.
Ses01F_script03_2_M030	ang	Well then you'll wake up the people downstairs.
Ses01F_script03_2_F032	neu	They are away in Tunis.
Ses01F_script03_2_M031	neu	This is no time of year for Tunis.
Ses01F_script03_2_M032	ang	I will do no such thing.
Ses01F_script03_2_F034	ang	Fine if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.
Ses01F_script03_2_M033	ang	Will you turn that off, it's driving me mad.
Ses01F_script03_2_F035	ang	You are far too temperamental, try to control yourself.
Ses01F_script03_2_M034	ang	Turn it off.
Ses01F_script03_2_F036	ang	I won't.  Let go, let go of me. Listen, listen?  I'm sick and tired of listening to you, you sadistic bully.
Ses01F_script03_2_M035	ang	Amanda, listen, listen.
Ses01F_script03_2_M036	ang	Oh.  That's very amusing indeed.
Ses01F_script03_2_F037	ang	Oh shut up.  Let go.  I hate you, I hate you.  Do you hear?  You are a conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.
Ses01F_script03_2_M037	ang	You are a vile, ill-tempered, loose living, wicked little beast and I never want to see you again as long as I live.
Ses01F_script03_2_F038	ang	This is the end.  Do you hear me?  Finally and forever.
Ses01F_script03_2_M038	ang	You're not going like this.
Ses01F_script03_2_F039	ang	Oh.  Yes I am.
Ses01F_script03_2_M039	ang	You're not.
Ses01F_script03_2_F040	ang	Yes I am.   Stop it. Stop it.  Let go of me. Oh.  You're a cruel fiend.  I loathe and I hate you. Marry you again?  Never, never, never. I hope you die in torment, you brute beast cad.
Ses01F_script03_2_M040	ang	Shut up. Shut up. God, I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling back to me on a bended knee.  You are a vile, ill-tempered, mean little wench and I never want to see you again as long as I live.
Ses01M_impro01_F000	ang	Next.
Ses01M_impro01_M000	fru	Yes, me. Okay, okay here we go.
Ses01M_impro01_F001	ang	My window is open.
Ses01M_impro01_M001	fru	Okay, so filled out all these forms  --
Ses01M_impro01_M002	fru	and I have This form of ID here so...
Ses01M_impro01_M003	neu	Yes, Jones.
Ses01M_impro01_F004	fru	What are you... what's...What are you applying for?
Ses01M_impro01_M005	fru	I'm just applying for another ID.
Ses01M_impro01_M006	fru	Yes.  I'm supposed to have three forms of ID for this.  It's a long story, I'm supposed to have three forms of ID for this other job I really don't get into but I need another...
Ses01M_impro01_M007	fru	I have it right here, yes.
Ses01M_impro01_F007	ang	No, I need your ID to give you a second ID.
Ses01M_impro01_F008	ang	It's really simple if you have a problem with it... Maybe you should--
Ses01M_impro01_M008	fru	But that's...
Ses01M_impro01_M009	fru	That's why I'm here, that's why I was waiting in this line.  I need to get another form of ID.
Ses01M_impro01_M010	neu	No, I don't have a passport.
Ses01M_impro01_F010	fru	You have a birth certificate?
Ses01M_impro01_M011	fru	I don't where it is though, I don't have with me.  Can I get it from somewhere?  I mean...
Ses01M_impro01_F011	ang	What do you expect me to do?
Ses01M_impro01_M012	fru	I probably have to go wait another line to get my birth certificate don't I?
Ses01M_impro01_F012	ang	Probably.
Ses01M_impro01_M013	fru	You're very helpful.  What's your name?
Ses01M_impro01_M015	fru	So can you help me or not?
Ses01M_impro01_F015	fru	I am..I don't..I don't understand what you want.  A driver's license or a California ID.
Ses01M_impro01_M016	fru	Okay. [BREATHING]
Ses01M_impro01_M017	fru	I need California ID.
Ses01M_impro01_M018	fru	On top of these other two forms of ID which I already have.
Ses01M_impro01_M019	fru	No, I don't have driver's license.
Ses01M_impro01_M020	ang	Did you even look at the form?  I filled it out all these questions--
Ses01M_impro01_F019	ang	Don't raise your voice with me.
Ses01M_impro01_F020	ang	Don't talk to me like I'm a child.
Ses01M_impro01_M022	fru	Okay.
Ses01M_impro01_F021	ang	Do you know how long I've been working here? How long have you lived in California?
Ses01M_impro01_M023	fru	If it makes you stop acting like a child.
Ses01M_impro01_F022	ang	Maybe you never been to the D.M.V. before, maybe you should get back in line.  You know what?  sit in line again and if you get my number ask for different one.
Ses01M_impro01_M025	ang	I am not...I'm not getting to back that line.
Ses01M_impro01_M026	fru	Okay, okay let's keep our voices down, okay?  I didn't come here to get in yelling match.
Ses01M_impro01_M027	fru	I did not come in here to get in a yelling match with you, all right?
Ses01M_impro01_F024	neu	Uh huh.  I didn't come here get in yelling match either.
Ses01M_impro01_M028	fru	Just try and help me.
Ses01M_impro01_F025	neu	They don't pay me enough to deal people like you.
Ses01M_impro01_M030	ang	Why?
Ses01M_impro01_M031	ang	Why, because I'm sick of talking to you.
Ses01M_impro01_M032	ang	'Cause you're obviously not talking to me, you're just yelling at me, berating me and telling me I can't fill out forms right.
Ses01M_impro01_M033	fru	Oh, no honey. And you're going to miss the Christmas card too. It's a shame. It's going to be a good, nice picture.
Ses01M_impro02_M000	neu	Hey, Joy come in here.
Ses01M_impro02_F000	neu	What's happening?
Ses01M_impro02_M001	sad	I have to go back.
Ses01M_impro02_M002	sad	I just got a letter I have to go back.
Ses01M_impro02_M003	sad	First thing tomorrow morning.
Ses01M_impro02_F003	fru	How...
Ses01M_impro02_F004	fru	How can they do that?
Ses01M_impro02_F005	fru	They said you're home for at least four years.
Ses01M_impro02_M006	fru	I guess they can do it,
Ses01M_impro02_M007	sad	The National Guard is I guess really spread thin and then everyone has to go.  We all have to go back, my whole companies going back.

Ses01M_script01_1_M007	sad	I guess he is.
Ses01M_script01_1_M008	fru	I don't know the meaning of it.  But I know we've made terrible mistake with father.
Ses01M_script01_1_F011	ang	What do you mean a mistake?
Ses01M_script01_1_M010	fru	I just--why shouldn't he walk the nights waiting for him, huh?  Do we contradict him do we say we don't have any hope any more that he's not coming back?
Ses01M_script01_1_F012	fru	What do you want to do, argue with him?
Ses01M_script01_1_M011	fru	I don't want to argue with him, it's just for God's sake it's time he realized that no one believes with him any more.

Ses01M_script01_1_M017	neu	I'm going to ask her to marry me.
Ses01M_script01_1_F019	fru	Well, that's only your business, Chris.
Ses01M_script01_1_M018	fru	You know it's not just my business.
Ses01M_script01_1_F020	ang	Well, what do you want me to do?  You're old enough known your own business.
Ses01M_script01_1_M019	fru	So it's okay then?  I'm just going to go ahead with it?
Ses01M_script01_1_M020	ang	See.  Then it's not just my business. Sometimes you infuriate me, you know that?  You know it's just your business too if I tell father and he throws a fit about it, huh?
Ses01M_script01_1_F022	fru	I'm just saying.
Ses01M_script01_1_F023	ang	I'm sorry.  I ignore what I've got to ignore. That girl is Larry's girl.
Ses01M_script01_1_M021	ang	She is not Larry's girl.
Ses01M_script01_1_F024	ang	From father's point of view he is not dead and you have no right to take his girl.  I'm just saying that you can go on from there if you know where to go but I'm saying I don't know where to go.  See, I don't know.
Ses01M_script01_1_M022	fru	I don't know why it is you know every time I reach out for something I have to pull back 'cause I'm afraid it's going to hurt somebody.  All my life...
Ses01M_script01_1_F025	neu	You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong in that.
Ses01M_script01_1_M023	ang	To hell with that.
Ses01M_script01_1_F026	neu	Did you ask Annie yet?
Ses01M_script01_1_M024	sad	No, I wanted to get this all sorted out first.
Ses01M_script01_1_F027	fru	Well, how do you know she's going to marry you?  Maybe she feels same way your father does.
Ses01M_script01_1_F028	fru	The trouble is you don't see enough women, you never did.
Ses01M_script01_1_M026	fru	So what?  I'm just--I'm not fast with women.
Ses01M_script01_1_F029	ang	I don't see why it has to be Annie.
Ses01M_script01_1_M027	fru	Because it is.
Ses01M_script01_1_F030	ang	That's a good answer but it doesn't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you went away to war, it's been five years.
Ses01M_script01_1_M028	fru	I don't know, it I think of her, I grew up next to her.  She is what I think of when I think of a wife.
Ses01M_script01_1_F031	sad	He thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl you're pronouncing him dead.
Ses01M_script01_1_F032	ang	Do you know what that'll do to you, to your father, do you know?  I don't.
Ses01M_script01_1_M030	fru	I've given it lots of thought.  And I keep coming back to the same thing.
Ses01M_script01_1_M031	fru	When I think of a family, when I think of my future I see Annie in the center of that and you know and if that can't happen here then I'll go somewhere else.
Ses01M_script01_1_M032	fru	I'll leave.  I'll get married and move somewhere else maybe New York.
Ses01M_script01_1_F035	ang	Are you crazy?
Ses01M_script01_1_F036	ang	You have a business here.  I said what the hell is this?
Ses01M_script01_1_M034	ang	Business?  The business doesn't inspire me.
Ses01M_script01_1_F037	ang	Oh, must you be inspired.
Ses01M_script01_1_M035	ang	Yes, yes I like it for one hour a day.  I don't care if I have to grub for money all day long when I come home I want it nice, I want a family, I want to kids and Annie is in the center of that.
Ses01M_script01_1_M036	fru	If that can't happen here...
Ses01M_script01_1_M037	neu	Yes, on this I would.
Ses01M_script01_1_F039	ang	Well, you don't want to think like that.
Ses01M_script01_1_M038	sad	Then help me stay here mom.
Ses01M_script01_1_F040	ang	All right but you don't think like that because what the hell is this all for.  This is all for you, what are we working for Chris? The whole shooting match is for you.
Ses01M_script01_1_M040	sad	Then help me stay.
Ses01M_script01_1_F041	ang	Well, you don't think like that.
Ses01M_script01_1_M041	ang	I am thinking like that.
Ses01M_script01_1_F042	ang	I don't understand you, do I?
Ses01M_script01_1_M042	sad	No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.
Ses01M_script01_1_F043	ang	Well, I can see that.
Ses01M_script01_2_F000	ang	Why did he invite her here?
Ses01M_script01_2_M000	neu	Well, maybe he wanted see her.
Ses01M_script01_2_F001	ang	It's been three and a half years.  Why all of a sudden?
Ses01M_script01_2_M001	neu	Well uh, He grew up next door to the girl, why wouldn't he want to see her?
Ses01M_script01_2_M002	fru	Don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anything he told you.
Ses01M_script01_2_M003	fru	How do you know he's even thinking about it?
Ses01M_script01_2_M004	fru	Oh so what?
Ses01M_script01_2_F004	ang	What is going on here, Joe?
Ses01M_script01_2_M005	fru	Okay, now listen, kids...

Ses01M_script01_2_M007	neu	And how do you know why she's waited.
Ses01M_script01_2_M008	fru	Okay, look it's a beautiful day.  Why are we arguing?

Ses01M_script01_2_M009	fru	What do you want me to do?  What do you want?
Ses01M_script01_2_F009	ang	I want you to---act like he is coming back.  Don't think I haven't noticed you, both of you since Chris invited her here.  I won't stand for any nonsense.
Ses01M_script01_2_M010	fru	Kate...
Ses01M_script01_2_M011	fru	[BREATHING]
Ses01M_script01_2_F011	ang	Oh, laugh at me, laugh all you like but why does this happen to very night she comes back?  She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look at it, Joe look.
Ses01M_script01_2_M012	fru	All right, calm yourself.
Ses01M_script01_2_F012	ang	Believe with me Joe, you got to believe. Only last week a boy came back missing longer then Larry you read it yourself.
Ses01M_script01_2_M013	fru	Okay, calm yourself. Alright.

Ses01M_script01_3_M002	sad	Why not?
Ses01M_script01_3_F004	neu	For one thing your mother as much as told me to go.
Ses01M_script01_3_F005	sad	[BREATHING] And then you've been kind of...
Ses01M_script01_3_M004	neu	What?
Ses01M_script01_3_F006	sad	You've been kind of embarrassed ever since I got here.

Ses01M_script01_3_F016	hap	I'll never forgive you for waiting so long.  All I did was sit around and wonder if I was crazy for thinking about you.

Ses01M_script01_3_M023	sad	I don't know.
Ses01M_script01_3_M024	sad	It's kind of all mixed up with all these other things.
Ses01M_script01_3_F022	sad	Wouldn't work like this.
Ses01M_script01_3_M025	sad	you know over seas I was in command of the company?
Ses01M_script01_3_F023	sad	Yeah, sure.

Ses01M_script01_3_F025	sad	[BREATHING]. Geez.
Ses01M_script01_3_M028	sad	Takes awhile to toss something like that off.  I mean they weren't just men, you know.
Ses01M_script01_3_M029	sad	For instance, there was this one time when this kid--it had been raining for like several days and he gave me his last pair of dry socks.
Ses01M_script01_3_M030	sad	He just put it in my pocket that's the kind of guys I had.

Ses01M_script01_3_M032	sad	And I had this idea as I was watching them go down like everything was being destroyed, you know.  But I felt like this one new thing was being made, you know it's kind of like this.  This monument...
Ses01M_script01_3_M033	sad	You know, that they were bringing something on to this earth, a kind of sacrifice you know.
Ses01M_script01_3_M034	sad	I thought I would change everything you know, and I got back here and it was- it was like nothing had changed at all...
Ses01M_script01_3_M035	sad	You know.  I went to work with dad and I started that whole rat race again...
Ses01M_script01_3_M036	sad	And no one had changed it was just like sort of random bus accident to them.
Ses01M_script01_3_M037	sad	Driving my new car and I felt guilty you know opening my bank book seeing a new refrigerator.
Ses01M_script01_3_M038	sad	'Cause you can take those things out of a war.  But you have to realize that those things came out of the love that a man can have for another man...
Ses01M_script01_3_M039	sad	And if you can't see that then it's just loot and there's blood all over it.
Ses01M_script01_3_M040	sad	I felt ashamed and I didn't want any part of it.  I guess I included you too.
Ses01M_script01_3_F026	sad	Do you still feel that way?
Ses01M_script01_3_M041	sad	I want you to know Annie.

Ses01M_script02_1_M002	exc	Look, there what's that, what's that?  Is it--
Ses01M_script02_1_F001	fru	Ugh...
Ses01M_script02_1_M004	exc	Oh, no I can't tell though.  Although probably if you can't tell it probably isn't them right, yeah.  Probably going to be like unmistakable, right?
Ses01M_script02_1_M005	exc	Gosh, this is great, isn't it?  This is awesome.  Oh, no you know what I forgot?

Ses01M_script02_1_M011	neu	Gosh, I should have brought it. I can't believe I forgot that.
Ses01M_script02_1_F007	neu	No.
Ses01M_script02_1_M014	exc	You know what we should've brought a blanket too.  Man, our blanket, our blanket.  Wish I had six-pack too, a six-pack would be just the ticket right about now, huh, six-pack.
Ses01M_script02_1_F008	neu	I'm fine.
Ses01M_script02_1_M016	exc	Oh yeah, I'm so excited right now I'm like a kid.
Ses01M_script02_1_M017	exc	I can't believe I got out of the house without my fly zipped up even.
Ses01M_script02_1_F009	hap	I wonder if they can hear me talk
Ses01M_script02_1_F010	fru	I'm cold.
Ses01M_script02_1_M020	fru	Do you want my jacket?
Ses01M_script02_1_F011	fru	It's after eleven, let's go home.
Ses01M_script02_1_M021	fru	What are you kidding?  We just got here.  We don't want to turn around and go home now.  What's the point coming all the way down here?
Ses01M_script02_1_F012	fru	There is no point.
Ses01M_script02_1_M022	neu	Right.
Ses01M_script02_1_F013	fru	That's my point.

Ses01M_script02_1_F014	ang	Then let's go.
Ses01M_script02_1_M024	fru	No, wait no, no that's not my point.  My point is there is no point and coming all the way down here if we just turn around and go home.
Ses01M_script02_1_M026	fru	Why not?
Ses01M_script02_1_M027	fru	It's not stupid.  It's a natural phenomenon.
Ses01M_script02_1_M028	ang	People in Kansas would have to get plane tickets and make hotel reservations to see this.  It's only forty minutes away; it's just too good to pass up.
Ses01M_script02_1_F017	ang	Pass what up?  These little fish swim out of the ocean, they flop around on the sand then they swim back and then they die.
Ses01M_script02_1_F018	fru	I don't know what you're so excited about.  This isn't a moon landing we're talking about, it's fish, it's a fish nobody even eats.
Ses01M_script02_1_M030	neu	Yeah, they do.
Ses01M_script02_1_F019	fru	Oh, Augie.
Ses01M_script02_1_M031	exc	Well, okay whatever, okay but it's a fish who do something that like no other fish do, you know, it's like those swallows that return to Capistrano or those like those lemmings that jumped off the cliffs, you know.
Ses01M_script02_1_M032	exc	It's like a little bit of the unexplainable, a little magic, a little mystery.  I just don't see how you can not be interested in this.

Ses01M_script02_1_F021	ang	Yes.

Ses01M_script02_1_F022	ang	Last year, you'll also remember we got--our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got into a big fight and we did not see the grunions.

Ses01M_script02_1_M042	exc	They just all turned at once and they just form this line as long as the California coast.  And they just started swimming...
Ses01M_script02_1_M043	exc	Like some little time release fire cracker went off inside their little tiny bodies.  And they all turned as one...
Ses01M_script02_1_M044	exc	And form the line and started swimming, swimming that would bring them to this point here...
Ses01M_script02_1_M045	exc	It's like urgency that's pure urge you know.  It's single-mindedness with no mind.

Ses01M_script02_2_F008	fru	Their life will start then.
Ses01M_script02_2_F009	fru	I'm sorry it still just fish to me.

Ses01M_script02_2_M012	fru	Why not?

Ses01M_script02_2_M014	fru	Okay we'll see them this year, this is a much better spot. Trust me.
Ses01M_script02_2_F015	ang	No we won't.  It's pointless it's like a waiting up to see Santa Claus.
Ses01M_script02_2_F016	ang	I feel like my whole life is going to be spent here on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly, waiting for fish to show up and the fish never show.

Ses01M_script02_2_M020	neu	Let's see, uh, I took a shower and, um, you were watching the news and you said the "the Grunions are running tonight," and I said "okay great, let's go."

Ses01M_script02_2_F022	sad	And I remember thinking this is it. finally, finally I'm as happy as I'm supposed to be.
Ses01M_script02_2_M022	neu	Wait a minute, I've got it.
Ses01M_script02_2_M023	neu	It was when we were driving passed that knickerbocker liquor locker and you would said, no you said "let's get some champagne" and I said "no time to wasting" or something like that.  That's what it is, right?
Ses01M_script02_2_F024	sad	I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things.

Ses01M_script02_2_M033	ang	A new carpet, a poodle, a suicide pact, ice cream, a back rub, what?  What?  What the hell do you want?
Ses01M_script02_2_F030	ang	I want something to turn out the way that it's supposed to.
Ses01M_script02_2_M034	fru	Well, welcome to the human race.
Ses01M_script02_2_M035	ang	You think nothing turns out how it's supposed to.  You think I had some grand idea going that four years down the line.  We would come to this beach and argue over fish?  No.
Ses01M_script02_2_M037	sad	No, no I'm just like you, I thought it was going to be all rosy cheeks and the bills would pay themselves and fish will always come and--
Ses01M_script02_2_M038	sad	No.  You know what you get?  You know what you get?  You get this.
Ses01M_script02_2_F031	ang	This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.
Ses01M_script02_2_M039	neu	Yeah, it is.
Ses01M_script02_2_F032	ang	Oh, sure this is standing on the beach, this is waiting, fighting.
Ses01M_script02_2_M040	neu	Right.
Ses01M_script02_2_F033	sad	This isn't anything like I thought anything would be.
Ses01M_script02_2_M041	sad	I know me neither.
Ses01M_script02_2_F034	sad	This is just this.  I mean it includes a lot and everything but it's--do you understand what I'm saying?
Ses01M_script02_2_M042	sad	I'm doing the best I can.
Ses01M_script02_2_F035	sad	I know that Augie, I really do.
Ses01M_script02_2_F036	sad	I just can't help wishing that I was somebody, somewhere else.
Ses01M_script02_2_M043	sad	Maybe if you were with somebody else too?
Ses01M_script02_2_F037	sad	I didn't say that.
Ses01M_script02_2_M044	sad	No, I know but--I know I don't make you happy.
Ses01M_script02_2_M045	sad	Yeah?
Ses01M_script02_2_F040	sad	You are the one who probably wishes he was with somebody else, someone who didn't take everything so seriously, someone who would enjoy yourself.
Ses01M_script02_2_M049	hap	Look what we got here.
Ses01M_script02_2_M050	neu	It's not champagne.

Ses01M_script03_1_M004	hap	I don't care then.

Ses01M_script03_1_F018	hap	How long will it last, this ludicrous, overbearing love of ours?
Ses01M_script03_1_M021	hap	We are figures of fun all right
Ses01M_script03_1_M022	hap	Ahh...who knows.
Ses01M_script03_1_F019	hap	Shall we always want to bicker and fight?
Ses01M_script03_1_F021	hap	If one of us dies...

Ses01M_script03_2_M022	ang	You know, it's a pity you didn't have any more brandy. It would have made you just a little less disagreeable.
Ses01M_script03_2_M023	ang	You know what?  You snap, you snap, you snap you're like a little adder.
Ses01M_script03_2_M024	ang	Nonsense.  They have a bag of venom behind of fangs and they snap.

Ses01M_script03_2_M035	ang	I will do no such thing.

Ses01M_script03_2_M042	ang	No you're not.
Ses01M_script03_2_M043	ang	Shut up. Shut up. I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling back to me on a bended knee. You are an evil tempered little vampire and I never want to see you again as long as I live.

Ses02F_impro01_M007	fru	I know, it gets long, but I can't do anything without your--do you have Social Security card, maybe?
Ses02F_impro01_F008	fru	Well, no.  I mean, I don't carry my original documents with me because if those things get destroyed, then what do you, you know what I mean, like if I loose my wallet or something, I'll never have them again.
Ses02F_impro01_F009	fru	I have my passport and I have my driver's license. And that's all I have.

Ses02F_impro01_F013	fru	And I can tell you where I was born and what time and by who and what day.
Ses02F_impro01_M013	fru	Okay.  But how do I--that's- that's not proof to me.  How do I know that, you know, that it's really you.  I need--
Ses02F_impro01_F014	fru	I can't go--I have to go back to work.  I don't have time to go back to my house and get all of that stuff and then get back in line and wait for another forty five minutes.

Ses02F_impro01_M018	fru	I--when you're going to the D.M.V., you usually need pretty professional identification--
Ses02F_impro01_M019	ang	You know, Official documentation--
Ses02F_impro01_F019	ang	Yeah, but your birth certificate--I mean, who carries around their birth certificate?  Nobody does that.

Ses02F_impro01_F020	ang	With your driver's license and your passport.  Just like everybody else.
Ses02F_impro01_M021	fru	But, without your drive--where-where- what about your identification without your driver's license?  I mean, you need--you needed something before then?
Ses02F_impro01_F021	ang	Who--you always use your driver's license.  I mean, you're not coming to the D.M.V. if you're not over sixteen and that's when you get your driver's license so you're never gonna need it anyway.
Ses02F_impro01_M022	fru	All right.  Well, um, you know, I'd love to help you, but--nothing I can do.
Ses02F_impro01_M023	fru	So, if you wanna go get your birth certificate, um, maybe come back--I don't--maybe you can talk to the person in the--in the front of line maybe.  I don't know.

Ses02F_impro04_M004	neu	I know.  I know. It's hard, but you just--you gotta keep going.  I mean, you've been going at it for so long, you know.  Something is definitely going to come up.  I-I know it will, because you're a good worker--
Ses02F_impro04_F005	fru	I just keep getting rejected.  I just keep getting rejected over and over and over again and it starts to make you feel like there must be something wrong with you that you can't get a job.
Ses02F_impro04_M005	neu	No.  It's--I mean, it's competitive, you know.  That's-That's what it is.  that's what you gotta be is competitive.

Ses02F_impro04_M006	neu	There...There are plenty of people out there with--with like, good jobs, you know, that are a lot...
Ses02F_impro04_M007	neu	...dumber than you.  I mean they're a lot worse off than you.  You are much better off than like a lot of those people in there. I know
Ses02F_impro04_F007	fru	I didn't have like one of those starts, you know, like a family member who was already in the business or something you know that could like give me a helping hand.
Ses02F_impro04_M008	neu	I know.  It makes it harder.  I mean it's definitely who you know in a lot of cases, but--
Ses02F_impro04_F008	fru	It's just so frustrating.  Like, I just--I just don't wanna do it anymore.  You know?  I just don't wanna like hit the pavement every single day with my resumes and going out there all the time.  You know, it's just like--
Ses02F_impro04_M009	neu	But you gotta.  Otherwise, what is--what's your other option?
Ses02F_impro04_F009	sad	I feel so worthless.

Ses02F_impro04_M011	neu	... and there's no reason that--that something won't come up like really soon.  All right?  So you just gotta--
Ses02F_impro04_F010	fru	And what would make you say that?  There doesn't seem to be any indicators that anything's going to get better.
Ses02F_impro04_M012	neu	Because I know you.  You know, and maybe once you get to know some more people, like talking to them and everything, they'll get to know you too and they'll realize they should've hired you three years ago.  You know? but  And- and they'll finally come around and believe me--it'll--you gotta-
Ses02F_impro04_F011	fru	It's just really hard.  I feel like their starting to get like a personal prejudice against me.  You know what I mean?  Like it's like suddenly it starts to feel like it's just you that they say no to and it's not that they're not taking applications and it's not that they're not hiring people, it's just you particularly they have some particular reason for just hating you.  You know?
Ses02F_impro04_M013	neu	Well maybe yeah, but maybe you get to that point where it's like you bug 'em and then they just don't wanna hear from you anymore, but you keep bugging them and bugging them and then it's gonna annoy them so much that they're gonna be like all right fine. you know
Ses02F_impro04_F012	fru	Or they'll never talk to me again.
Ses02F_impro04_M014	fru	Or, well, no.  Okay. you -[GARBAGE]
Ses02F_impro04_F013	fru	I-I just I think maybe I should try something else.  I mean, I-I don't know.  All growing up this is the only thing that I ever wanted to do and yet I can't.  I'm not physically able apparently.  I mean--
Ses02F_impro04_M015	neu	That obviously that's not true though.  I mean, you've done this before.  You've done all the work like this before, you know, and and you've gotten people saying oh, you're so good and like you know--
Ses02F_impro04_F014	fru	I guess the money shouldn't matter to me, but--Somehow it does.  You know? It's not like I do it for the money, but

Ses02F_impro04_M017	neu	Well, you've gotta live.
Ses02F_impro04_F015	fru	you have to--I mean, if you're hired by somebody, then you're not a professional, you're an amateur and that means that you're not good enough.
Ses02F_impro04_M018	neu	I mean, it's just, it's really--I don't know, yeah, it's about their opinions and it's about, I don't know, just getting yourself out there and--
Ses02F_impro04_F016	sad	I just wanna crawl in a hole, you know.  Like it just makes you not wanna even open your eyes in the morning.
Ses02F_impro04_M019	neu	Well, come on, come on.  Thinking about it like this is definitely not gonna help either though.
Ses02F_impro05_F000	neu	Hi, um, excuse me, I believe that the airline lost my baggage.

Ses02F_impro05_F001	neu	No, it didn't. um It didn't come out and I don't see it anywhere around here, so what can you do about that?

Ses02F_impro05_F006	ang	That's all, that's all, that's all you're going to do is just give me fifty dollars and say go have fun on your vacation without any of your stuff?
Ses02F_impro05_M007	neu	I think, um, maybe you can file a claim if you want and turn it in to our main office--
Ses02F_impro05_F007	fru	Yes, yes, I would like to file a claim, but what are you gonna--I mean, is it just gonna show up magically out of nowhere?

Ses02F_impro05_M009	neu	Yes, I know. I know-. It's It's frustrating.  Unfortunately though-- um
Ses02F_impro05_F010	ang	Because you don't seem to care very much, you know.
Ses02F_impro05_M010	neu	By checking your bags, you--you, you know- admit to the liability that's- that's at risk--
Ses02F_impro05_F011	fru	I didn't sign anything.
Ses02F_impro05_M011	neu	Right, well, by checking in your bags, you agreed to, you know, at the will of the--
Ses02F_impro05_M012	neu	You paid for the flight and then your bags were checked at--it's a service that the airline provides for us.  So so, really, it's really the risk was taken and, I'm sorry, but there's really nothing else we can do.  So do you want--do you want the reimbursement?
Ses02F_impro05_F013	fru	[BREATHING] Well, sure, yeah, I guess I'll go buy dinner and then be--have nothing for the rest of my entire vacation.  I'm supposed to be here for three weeks.  What am I gonna do without anything for three weeks?
Ses02F_impro05_M013	neu	Well, there are-there are some shops here in- in the airport--
Ses02F_impro05_F014	fru	But fifty dollars isn't going to get me anything.

Ses02F_impro05_F015	fru	Isn't there anything else you can do?
Ses02F_impro05_M015	neu	probably even talk to--
Ses02F_impro05_F016	fru	I mean, is there somebody you can call?  Or the guy that put the stuff on the--on the plane.  I mean, are they--they must be really irresponsible to have just disappeared my baggage.  I mean, did it get stolen?
Ses02F_impro05_M016	neu	Right, that--that gets taken care of-- That gets taken care of.  We get we do, you know, we investigate those and just make sure that um- they're not doing their own thing with them so--uh

Ses02F_impro05_M017	neu	but Unfortunately sometimes is--
Ses02F_impro05_M018	neu	Well, that's--that's what I'm saying--
Ses02F_impro05_F018	fru	There needs to be better security here.
Ses02F_impro05_M019	neu	Okay.  Well that that could be something that you put on on the claim--on on the complaint form if you want.  And provide us with your information while you're here and then, maybe, if it turns up, then we'll send it right over.
Ses02F_impro05_F019	ang	It sounds like it's such a little like oh well no big deal whatever.  It's a big deal to me.
Ses02F_impro05_M020	neu	All right, Miss, I-I know.  I realize this. But Like I said, there are several people that are in your same situation, so, um, it's not--it's not totally uncommon and I'm actually gonna have to ask you to move so I can help the next person.

Ses02F_impro07_F020	exc	You know what I mean?  Like, it's like exactly what I want.
Ses02F_impro07_F021	exc	Well, you know, I've thought about it but they have so many things that I might--Like try some things out first...

Ses02F_impro08_M001	fru	Ok.  I've- I've just been talking to this machine for the past half hour and I can't-can't get anything done.  I've been trying to book this vacation this entire time.
Ses02F_impro08_F001	neu	All right, sir.
Ses02F_impro08_M002	fru	I know, I'm sorry.  It's-It's just that it's been a little frustrating because--
Ses02F_impro08_F002	neu	I completely understand.  Automated systems are very difficult sometimes.
Ses02F_impro08_M003	neu	Okay.
Ses02F_impro08_F003	neu	Um, how may I help you.  You're trying to book a specific flight?
Ses02F_impro08_M004	fru	Well, yeah, I mean I heard there was like these package deals and that maybe I could get a like a hotel or something like that. and-
Ses02F_impro08_F004	neu	Oh, yeah, absolutely.  You know, and especially because you've been waiting so long and I know that, um, you've been having a difficult time.

Ses02F_impro08_F008	neu	I can do that right now for you. No, absolutely.  I can take care of you all the way through to the end.
Ses02F_impro08_F009	neu	All I'm going to need is your credit card number but just give me one moment. So-
Ses02F_impro08_M006	neu	[BREATHING] that's good.

Ses02F_impro08_F011	neu	Absolutely. we we
Ses02F_impro08_F012	neu	Yes, I completely understand.  Actually, our-our airline only uses five star hotel and above.  Except we charge at a three star hotel rate because, as a corporation, we are able to get a deal from the hotels themselves.
Ses02F_impro08_F013	neu	So, you will absolutely be in a high rated great hotel and we can make sure that it's in a area of town that you like as well.
Ses02F_impro08_M008	neu	Okay. So--
Ses02F_impro08_F014	neu	Yeah.
Ses02F_impro08_M009	neu	Well, you know, we wanted to--we wanted to go to Maui and--That was a
Ses02F_impro08_F015	neu	Okay.
Ses02F_impro08_M010	neu	--you know, the kids wanna go to the beach and stuff and so--um
Ses02F_impro08_F016	neu	Great.  How many seats?
Ses02F_impro08_M011	neu	Well, it's gonna be four of them.
Ses02F_impro08_F017	neu	Okay.  Great.  Four seats.  I'll book you for four seats.
Ses02F_impro08_M012	neu	All right.  And can they like all get together?
Ses02F_impro08_F018	neu	Oh, yeah, absolutely.  Um- Would you like window seats or aisles?
Ses02F_impro08_M013	neu	Um- You know, window is nice. I guess
Ses02F_impro08_F019	neu	Okay, I can do um- a win- -two like a window and a aisle and a window and an aisle next to each other so that each of you can sit two by two. And switch around maybe?
Ses02F_impro08_F020	neu	Okay.  Great.  What time of the day would you like?
Ses02F_impro08_M015	neu	Uh, well, yeah, I think we were just--you know, whenever best available, I guess.  You know--
Ses02F_impro08_F021	neu	All right.  Great.  Well we have a very open flight that leaves at nine a.m. and fortunately uh the time change actually goes um backwards from that.
Ses02F_impro08_F022	neu	So, it's a five hour flight, but you'll arrive only at eleven a clock in the morning.  So that day, you can have plenty of time to get to your hotel--Rest up and then still have a nice afternoon your first afternoon in Maui.
Ses02F_impro08_M016	neu	And, like, there's there's shuttles or something that I can get to the hotel.
Ses02F_impro08_F023	neu	Absolutely.  That actually goes in on the same package with our hotel.  You just give me your address.  We'll come and pick up a time that allows you to get to your flight with plenty of time to spare.
Ses02F_impro08_F024	neu	And a there will also be a shuttle waiting for you to take you to the appropriate hotel.
Ses02F_impro08_F025	neu	Yeah--I completely understand.  It's a difficult process sometimes and we want to make traveling as easy as possible.
Ses02F_impro08_M018	neu	All right.  So we're confirmed then or do you--All right.
Ses02F_impro08_F026	neu	Absolutely. Thank you so much for calling and we hope that you will come to us again.
Ses02F_impro08_M019	neu	Okay.
Ses02F_impro08_F027	neu	Thank you.
Ses02F_script01_1_F004	sad	Did you talk to him?
Ses02F_script01_1_F005	sad	He cried hard?
Ses02F_script01_1_F006	sad	What was he doing out here at that hour?
Ses02F_script01_1_F011	fru	What do you want to do argue with him?
Ses02F_script01_1_M011	ang	Why shouldn't he dream of him and walk the nights waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore?  That we haven't had hope for years now?
Ses02F_script01_1_F012	fru	You can't say that to him.
Ses02F_script01_1_M012	fru	We've got to say it to him.
Ses02F_script01_1_F013	fru	Can you prove it?  How can you prove it?
Ses02F_script01_1_M013	ang	For God sakes, it's been three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane.
Ses02F_script01_1_F014	fru	To you it is and to me, but not to him.  I mean, you can talk yourself blue in the face, but he--there's no body and no grave so where are you?
Ses02F_script01_1_M015	fru	All right.  All right.  Listen to me.  You know why I brought Annie here don't you?
Ses02F_script01_1_F017	sad	I've got an idea, but what's the story?
Ses02F_script01_1_M017	neu	I'm gonna ask her to marry me.
Ses02F_script01_1_F018	neu	Well, that's only your business, Chris.
Ses02F_script01_1_M018	fru	You know it's not only my business.
Ses02F_script01_1_F019	ang	What do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind.
Ses02F_script01_1_M019	fru	So it's all right then?
Ses02F_script01_1_M020	fru	I'll go ahead with it?
Ses02F_script01_1_M021	ang	Well, then it isn't just my business--
Ses02F_script01_1_F021	neu	I'm just saying that--
Ses02F_script01_1_M023	ang	She's not Larry's girl.
Ses02F_script01_1_F023	fru	From your father's point of view, he isn't dead.  And you've no right to take his girl.
Ses02F_script01_1_F024	fru	And you can go on from there if you know where to go, but I don't know where to go.  See, I don't know.  Now what can I do for you?
Ses02F_script01_1_M024	fru	I don't know why, but, every time I reach out for something that I want, I have to pull back 'cause someone else will suffer.  My whole bloody life.  Time after time after time.
Ses02F_script01_1_F025	neu	You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong with that.
Ses02F_script01_1_M025	ang	To hell with that.
Ses02F_script01_1_F026	neu	[BREATHING] Have you asked Annie yet?
Ses02F_script01_1_F027	neu	Well, how do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way your father does.
Ses02F_script01_1_M027	sad	Well, if she does, then that's the end of it.  But from her letters, I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out.  And then we'll thrash it out with Dad, right?  Mom, don't avoid me.
Ses02F_script01_1_F028	sad	Trouble is, you don't see enough women.
Ses02F_script01_1_F029	fru	You never did.
Ses02F_script01_1_F030	fru	I just don't see why it has to be Annie.
Ses02F_script01_1_M029	neu	Because it is.
Ses02F_script01_1_F031	fru	Well, that's a good answer, but it doesn't answer anything.  I mean, you've been away for--at war.  It's been five years.
Ses02F_script01_1_M031	fru	These years when I think of a wife, I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram?
Ses02F_script01_1_F032	fru	I don't want a diagram.  Umm-- He thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl and you're pronouncing him dead.
Ses02F_script01_1_F033	fru	I mean, what's gonna happen to your father?  Do you know?  I don't.
Ses02F_script01_1_M032	fru	All right.  All right, then, Mom.
Ses02F_script01_1_F034	fru	I just--give it some more thought.
Ses02F_script01_1_M033	fru	I've given it three years of thought.  I thought that if I waited Dad would forget about Larry and we could have a regular wedding and everything happy.
Ses02F_script01_1_F036	ang	Are you crazy?
Ses02F_script01_1_M036	ang	I've been a good son too long.  A good sucker.  I'm through with it.
Ses02F_script01_1_F037	ang	What about the business?  What the hell is this?
Ses02F_script01_1_M037	ang	The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.
Ses02F_script01_1_F038	ang	Must you be inspired?
Ses02F_script01_1_M038	ang	Yes.  I like it an hour a day.  If I'm gonna grub for my money all day long, at least in the evening I want it beautiful.
Ses02F_script01_1_M040	neu	Yes, on this I would.
Ses02F_script01_1_F040	ang	Well, you don't want to think like that.
Ses02F_script01_1_M042	fru	I know.  I know, Mom.  Just help me stay here.
Ses02F_script01_1_F042	fru	All right.  Just-- just don't go thinkin' that way, you hear me?
Ses02F_script01_1_M043	neu	I am thinkin' that way.
Ses02F_script01_1_F043	fru	I don't understand you, do I?
Ses02F_script01_1_M044	neu	No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.
Ses02F_script01_2_M001	neu	Well, maybe he just wanted to see her again.
Ses02F_script01_2_M002	neu	What do you mean?  He lived next door to the girl all his life.  Why wouldn't he want to see her again?
Ses02F_script01_2_M004	neu	How do you know he's even thinking of it?
Ses02F_script01_2_F005	ang	It's got that all about it.
Ses02F_script01_2_M005	neu	Well, so what?
Ses02F_script01_2_M006	neu	Now, listen Kate.
Ses02F_script01_2_M007	neu	You can't read her mind.
Ses02F_script01_2_F008	fru	Well then why is she still single?  I mean, New York is full of men.  Why isn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's crazy, but she's waited.
Ses02F_script01_2_M008	neu	How do you know why she's waited?
Ses02F_script01_2_F009	fru	She knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right.
Ses02F_script01_2_M009	fru	Look, it's a nice day.  What are we arguing for?
Ses02F_script01_2_M010	fru	Well, what do you want me to do about it?
Ses02F_script01_2_F011	fru	I want you to act like he's coming back.  Both of you.  Don't you think I haven't noticed since she got here.  I won't stand for any nonsense.
Ses02F_script01_2_M011	fru	But Kate--
Ses02F_script01_2_F012	ang	Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.  I mean, laugh--laugh at me, but...
Ses02F_script01_2_F013	ang	But why did that happen the very night she came here?  She sleeps in his room and his memorial breaks to pieces.  Just look.  Look at it.
Ses02F_script01_2_M012	fru	Calm yourself.
Ses02F_script01_2_F014	fru	Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand all alone.
Ses02F_script01_2_M013	fru	Calm yourself.
Ses02F_script01_2_F015	fru	Last week, a man turned up in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  I mean, you read it yourself.
Ses02F_script01_2_M014	fru	All right.  All right.  Calm yourself.
Ses02F_script01_2_F016	fru	You, above all, have to believe.
Ses02F_script01_2_F017	fru	Just--just don't stop believing.
Ses02F_script01_2_M016	ang	What does that mean?  Me above all?
Ses02F_script01_2_M017	ang	Look at you.  Look at you shaking.
Ses02F_script01_2_F018	fru	I can't help it.
Ses02F_script01_3_M001	neu	You're not sorry you came?
Ses02F_script01_3_F009	sad	from her point of view, why else would I come?
Ses02F_script01_3_M010	exc	You feel it's wrong here, don't you?  This yard, this chair.  I want you to be ready for me.  I don't want to have to win you away from anything.
Ses02F_script01_3_F012	hap	I almost got married two years ago.
Ses02F_script01_3_F013	hap	You started to write me and--
Ses02F_script01_3_F014	hap	Every day since.
Ses02F_script01_3_F016	hap	I will never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I did was sit and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.
Ses02F_script01_3_M020	sad	No.  Nothing like that.
Ses02F_script01_3_F020	sad	Then, what's wrong?  I mean, even in your letters there was some--something ashamed.
Ses02F_script01_3_M021	sad	Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me.
Ses02F_script01_3_F021	sad	You've gotta tell me.
Ses02F_script01_3_M022	sad	I don't know how to start.
Ses02F_script01_3_F022	sad	It wouldn't work this way.
Ses02F_script01_3_M023	sad	It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in command of a company?
Ses02F_script01_3_F023	sad	Yeah, sure.
Ses02F_script01_3_M024	sad	Well, I lost them.
Ses02F_script01_3_F024	sad	How many?
Ses02F_script01_3_M025	sad	Just about all.
Ses02F_script01_3_F025	sad	Oh, gee.
Ses02F_script01_3_M026	sad	It takes some time for a guy to toss that off.  'Cause they weren't just men.
Ses02F_script01_3_M027	sad	For instance, one time, it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.  I put them in pocket.  It's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had.
Ses02F_script01_3_M028	sad	They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today.
Ses02F_script01_3_M029	sad	I got this idea watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed, see, but it seemed that there was one new thing being made.  A sort of responsibility.  Man for man.
Ses02F_script01_3_M030	sad	You know what I mean?  To show that, to bring that onto the Earth again, like some kind of monument and everyone would feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him.
Ses02F_script01_3_M031	sad	Then I came back and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them seemed like sort of a bus accident.  I went to work with Dad and that rat race again.
Ses02F_script01_3_M032	sad	And I felt what you said, ashamed somehow 'cause nobody was changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book, drive the new car, see the new refrigerator.
Ses02F_script01_3_M033	sad	I mean, you can take those things out of a war, but when you drive that car, you've gotta know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've gotta be a little better because of it.
Ses02F_script01_3_M034	sad	Because otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it.  And I didn't want to take any of it.  And I guess that included you.
Ses02F_script01_3_F026	sad	You still feel that way?
Ses02F_script01_3_F029	hap	What'll I do with a fortune?
Ses02F_script02_1_M000	exc	What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.
Ses02F_script02_1_M001	exc	This is great, isn't it?  Look at the night we've got here, couldn't be better.
Ses02F_script02_1_M002	exc	I would have liked to have gone a little further up the coast to get away from the lights and the people, but I was afraid we'd miss it.
Ses02F_script02_1_M003	exc	How you doing?
Ses02F_script02_1_M004	exc	Is that--no--is that just foam?  I can't even tell.
Ses02F_script02_1_M005	exc	Well, I guess we can tell, it probably isn't right?  Probably be unmistakable don't you think?
Ses02F_script02_1_M006	exc	How you doing?  Aw, you know what I forgot?  I forgot to bring my flashlight.  Oh, how could I be so stupid?  I should've brought my flashlight.
Ses02F_script02_1_F001	neu	What flashlight?
Ses02F_script02_1_M009	neu	Oh, well sure.
Ses02F_script02_1_M010	neu	Right, of course.  Our flashlight.  Mine and yours.  I mean, me flashlight is su flashlight naturally.
Ses02F_script02_1_M012	neu	I wonder, do they always run during a full moon?  I can't remember if it was full last year.  Do you remember?
Ses02F_script02_1_F005	neu	Yeah.
Ses02F_script02_1_M013	neu	You cold?  Do you want my jacket?  Oh, we should've brought the blanket.  Our blanket.
Ses02F_script02_1_M014	exc	This is great, isn't it?  A six pack would be just the ticket right now.
Ses02F_script02_1_M015	exc	I can't believe I forgot.  I'm like a kid.  It's amazing I got out of the house with my fly zipped.
Ses02F_script02_1_M016	exc	You think they can hear us talk?  Or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around?
Ses02F_script02_1_M017	neu	Do you want my jacket?
Ses02F_script02_1_F007	fru	It's after eleven, let's just go home.
Ses02F_script02_1_M019	neu	Right.
Ses02F_script02_1_M020	neu	That's my point too.
Ses02F_script02_1_M021	neu	No. No. That's not my point.  The point is there's no point in coming down if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it?
Ses02F_script02_1_M024	exc	Think about the people in Kansas, they had to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to see this.  We live forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up.
Ses02F_script02_1_F013	fru	Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, they flop around, and swim away.  And then they die.
Ses02F_script02_1_M025	exc	Yeah, but that moment on the beach, is the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping is laying eggs or what do you--spawning or mating.  I mean,
Ses02F_script02_1_M026	exc	this is a big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy.
Ses02F_script02_1_F014	fru	What are you so excited about?  I mean, it's not a moon landing we're talking about here.  It's fish.  It's a fish nobody even eats.
Ses02F_script02_1_M027	fru	Yeah they do.
Ses02F_script02_1_F015	fru	Ah, Augie.
Ses02F_script02_1_M028	exc	Alright.  But it's fish that do something that none of the other fish do.  Like the swallows returning to Capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs.
Ses02F_script02_1_F016	fru	I'm just not.
Ses02F_script02_1_M031	neu	I don't get it.  The first time we came here, you said it was the best night of your life.
Ses02F_script02_1_F018	fru	Last year, you will also remember our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got in a big fight over nothing, and we didn't see the grunions.
Ses02F_script02_1_M033	neu	We weren't in a good spot.
Ses02F_script02_1_F019	neu	We didn't see them the first time either.
Ses02F_script02_1_M035	exc	There is that--no that's just seaweed isn't it?
Ses02F_script02_1_M036	exc	Oh man, this is great, isn't it?  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  Here, think about this, all right, I know you're not interested, but think about this.
Ses02F_script02_1_M039	exc	all as one, this time release instinctual little firecracker went off and they all turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.  And they're swimming right now as if that's all that matters.
Ses02F_script02_1_M040	exc	It's like single mindedness with no mind.  It's urgency that's pure urge.  They don't know what drives them.  They don't ask it a question or give it a name.
Ses02F_script02_1_M041	exc	They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them right here to where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death.
Ses02F_script02_1_M042	exc	Ah, God, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  Look, all my hairs are popped up.
Ses02F_script02_1_M043	neu	Well, so what do you think?
Ses02F_script02_1_F021	neu	About what?
Ses02F_script02_1_M044	neu	What I was saying.
Ses02F_script02_2_M000	exc	Well, so what do you think?
Ses02F_script02_2_F000	neu	About what?
Ses02F_script02_2_M001	neu	What I was saying.
Ses02F_script02_2_F001	fru	It's ridiculous.
Ses02F_script02_2_M002	neu	It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.
Ses02F_script02_2_M003	neu	Well, I'm not the only one.  Look at all these people.
Ses02F_script02_2_M005	neu	Carla, can I ask you something?  Don't take this wrong, but are you having your period?
Ses02F_script02_2_F005	ang	God damn it, Augie, don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  You always ask me that.  It's insulting.
Ses02F_script02_2_M006	fru	Well, what's bugging you?
Ses02F_script02_2_F006	ang	We just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.
Ses02F_script02_2_M007	neu	There's nothing to it.  We come here, the grunion arrive, they do their little fish business, we go ooh, ah, look at the fish.  They go home. We go home.
Ses02F_script02_2_F007	fru	For heaven sake, we're not going to see the grunions.
Ses02F_script02_2_M008	fru	Why not?
Ses02F_script02_2_F008	fru	We never do, do we?  I mean, have we ever?
Ses02F_script02_2_M009	neu	We've missed them twice.  That's not ever.
Ses02F_script02_2_F009	fru	Twice is every time we've tried. That's ever.
Ses02F_script02_2_M010	neu	Well, we'll see them this year.
Ses02F_script02_2_F010	fru	No, we won't.  It's pointless.  It's like waiting up to see Santa Claus.
Ses02F_script02_2_F011	ang	I mean, I feel like my whole life is gonna be spent standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for the fish to show up.  And the fish won't show up.
Ses02F_script02_2_M011	fru	I thought you wanted to see it.
Ses02F_script02_2_F012	fru	You don't understand anything I'm saying.
Ses02F_script02_2_M012	fru	No, of course not.
Ses02F_script02_2_F013	fru	I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking that this is gonna be the time and it never is.
Ses02F_script02_2_M013	neu	It's just fish.  Nothing to get traumatized about.
Ses02F_script02_2_M014	fru	All right.  Look, I've been trying to work this backwards, but I cannot seem to figure out the exact moment that we took a turn for the worst.
Ses02F_script02_2_M016	neu	You said, "Hey the grunion are running tonight."  I said, "Great, let's go.  I feel lucky."
Ses02F_script02_2_M017	neu	Okay, so I'm putting on my jacket, putting out the animals, getting the car out of the garage--
Ses02F_script02_2_F015	sad	Do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago, right after we got married.
Ses02F_script02_2_F016	sad	I thought I was pregnant, you had a bottle of champagne, but no glasses.  You asked me to dance, so we kicked off our shoes and you popped the cork.
Ses02F_script02_2_F017	sad	And while we were dancing, you said the softest, most intimate things to me right into my ear so that I could feel them as much as hear them.
Ses02F_script02_2_F018	sad	And I remember thinking, this is it.  You know, at last--at last I am as happy as I am supposed to be.
Ses02F_script02_2_M018	neu	Wait a minute.  I've got it.
Ses02F_script02_2_F019	sad	Just dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.
Ses02F_script02_2_M019	neu	It was in the car, right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, "let's get some champagne," and I said, "time's a wasting" or something like that, right?
Ses02F_script02_2_M020	neu	Yeah, of course, I see it now.  You want this to be like that other time, right?  That's it, right?
Ses02F_script02_2_F020	sad	I'd rather not remember some things.  I would rather not hope for some things.
Ses02F_script02_2_M021	neu	Okay, yeah, sure, I see it now.  Listen, you wanna dance?
Ses02F_script02_2_F021	sad	No.
Ses02F_script02_2_M022	neu	You want me to go get some champagne?
Ses02F_script02_2_F022	sad	No.
Ses02F_script02_2_M023	neu	Take off our shoes?
Ses02F_script02_2_M024	fru	Well, what?  You want me to breathe in your ear?
Ses02F_script02_2_F024	sad	No.
Ses02F_script02_2_M025	fru	You wanna get married again?
Ses02F_script02_2_F025	fru	No.
Ses02F_script02_2_M026	fru	What?  What?  You want a divorce?
Ses02F_script02_2_F026	fru	No.
Ses02F_script02_2_M027	fru	A vacation?
Ses02F_script02_2_F027	fru	No.
Ses02F_script02_2_M028	fru	A new carpet?  A poodle?  Ice cream?  Back rub?  A suicide pact?  What?  What?  Carla, what the hell do you want?
Ses02F_script02_2_M029	ang	Well, welcome to the human race.  Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed?  That four years down the road, we'd be at the beach yelling at each other over fish?
Ses02F_script02_2_M031	sad	No, Carla, I'm just like you.  I thought it was gonna be all peaches and roses and sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'll have three fat rosy kids and ha, ha, baby, the joke's on us
Ses02F_script02_2_M032	fru	'cause you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This.
Ses02F_script02_2_M033	neu	Yes, it is.
Ses02F_script02_2_M034	neu	Right.
Ses02F_script02_2_F031	sad	Well.  This isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.
Ses02F_script02_2_M035	sad	I know, me neither.
Ses02F_script02_2_M036	sad	I'm doing the best I can.
Ses02F_script02_2_F033	sad	I know that, Augie.  Really, I do.
Ses02F_script02_2_F034	sad	I know that you meant this to be special and nice and the sand and the moon and all, but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.
Ses02F_script02_2_M037	sad	Maybe if you were with somebody else too.
Ses02F_script02_2_F035	sad	I didn't say that.
Ses02F_script02_2_M038	sad	No, I know.  But still.  I know I don't make you happy.
Ses02F_script02_2_F038	sad	You're the one who probably wishes you were with someone else.  Someone who--you'd rather enjoy yourself and didn't take everything so hard.
Ses02F_script02_2_M041	hap	I don't know.  It seemed like a pretty good spot to me.  I mean, look at the view you have of the moon from here.
Ses02F_script02_2_M042	hap	Well, look what we have here.
Ses02F_script02_2_F041	hap	Augie, you brought refreshments.
Ses02F_script02_2_M043	hap	It's not champagne.
Ses02F_script02_2_F042	hap	Well, then we don't need glasses.
Ses02F_script02_2_F043	hap	No.  I think you might be right.  Maybe this is the spot after all.
Ses02F_script02_2_F044	sad	Augie, I'm sorry.
Ses02F_script02_2_M045	hap	Shh.  If we're very quiet the fish might come.
Ses02F_script02_2_F045	hap	Or not.
Ses02F_script03_1_M001	neu	I wonder.
Ses02F_script03_1_M004	neu	I don't care then.
Ses02F_script03_1_M005	neu	Hello?  Hello?  What?  Wrong number.
Ses02F_script03_1_F005	exc	Ah, it send shivers up my spine.
Ses02F_script03_1_F006	hap	Behave exquisitely.
Ses02F_script03_1_M007	neu	With the most perfect poise?
Ses02F_script03_1_F007	hap	Oh, of course.  I shall probably do a court curtsy.
Ses02F_script03_1_M008	neu	Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy.  Do they?
Ses02F_script03_1_F008	hap	What's so horrible is that one can't stay happy.
Ses02F_script03_1_M009	neu	Oh, darling, don't say that.
Ses02F_script03_1_F009	hap	It's true.  The whole business is a very poor joke.
Ses02F_script03_1_M010	neu	Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing, love?
Ses02F_script03_1_F010	hap	Yes, meaning just that.
Ses02F_script03_1_M012	neu	You mustn't be serious, my dear one.  That's just what they want.
Ses02F_script03_1_F012	neu	Who's they?
Ses02F_script03_1_M013	neu	All those futile moralists that try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything.  All their sacred shibboleths.
Ses02F_script03_1_M014	neu	Flippancy brings out the acid in their damn sweetness and light.
Ses02F_script03_1_F013	neu	If I laugh at everything, then I must laugh at us too.
Ses02F_script03_1_M015	neu	Certainly, you must.  We're figures of fun, alright.
Ses02F_script03_1_F014	neu	Well how long will it last us, this ludicrous overbearing love of ours.
Ses02F_script03_1_M016	neu	Who knows.
Ses02F_script03_1_F015	neu	Well, shall we always want to bicker and fight?
Ses02F_script03_1_M017	neu	No, that desire will fade.  Along with our passion.
Ses02F_script03_1_F016	neu	Oh, dear, shall we like that?
Ses02F_script03_1_M018	neu	Depends on how well we've played.
Ses02F_script03_1_F017	neu	Well, what happens if one of us dies?  I mean, does the one that's left still laugh?
Ses02F_script03_1_M019	exc	Yes.  Yes. With all his might.
Ses02F_script03_1_M020	exc	No. No, it isn't.  Death is very laughable.  Such a cunning little mystery.  All done with mirrors.
Ses02F_script03_1_F019	hap	Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense.
Ses02F_script03_1_M021	neu	So is everyone else in the long run.
Ses02F_script03_1_M022	exc	Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow our trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as much as we can.  Like quite idiotic, very small school children.  Let's savor the delight of the moment.
Ses02F_script03_1_M023	exc	Come and kiss me, darling, before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.
Ses02F_script03_1_F020	hap	Elliott, worms don't pop.
Ses02F_script03_1_M024	neu	I don't care what you do.  See, you could paint yourself green and dance naked in the Place Vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word.  As long as you love me best.
Ses02F_script03_1_F021	hap	Oh, thank you, dear.  The same applies to you except that if I catch so much as looking at another woman, I'll kill you.
Ses02F_script03_1_M025	neu	You remember that awful scene we had in Venice?
Ses02F_script03_1_F022	hap	Which particular one?
Ses02F_script03_1_M026	neu	The one when you bought that little painted wooden snake in the Piazza and put it on my bed.
Ses02F_script03_1_F023	hap	Charles.  That was his name.  Charles.  He did wriggle so beautifully.
Ses02F_script03_1_F024	hap	Yes, I know you did.  You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.
Ses02F_script03_1_M028	neu	How long did that row last?
Ses02F_script03_1_F025	hap	It went in intermittently for days.
Ses02F_script03_1_M029	neu	The worst one was in Cannes when your curling iron burnt a hole in my new dressing gown.
Ses02F_script03_1_F026	hap	It burned my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.
Ses02F_script03_1_F027	neu	That was the first time you ever hit me.
Ses02F_script03_1_M031	neu	I didn't hit you very hard.
Ses02F_script03_1_F028	hap	The manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor, biting and scratching like panthers.
Ses02F_script03_1_M032	exc	Oh, I'll never forget his face.
Ses02F_script03_1_F029	exc	It was ridiculous.  Completely ridiculous.
Ses02F_script03_1_M033	neu	We were very much younger then.
Ses02F_script03_1_M034	neu	As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.
Ses02F_script03_2_M000	neu	As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.
Ses02F_script03_2_M001	neu	I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.
Ses02F_script03_2_M006	ang	What of it?
Ses02F_script03_2_M007	ang	Well, what about me?
Ses02F_script03_2_F007	neu	Well, if you hadn't been so suspicious and nosey, you never would have known a thing about it.
Ses02F_script03_2_M009	neu	Me, too.  Bored stiff.  You want some brandy?
Ses02F_script03_2_M011	neu	No particular reason.  Anyhow they were very small ones.
Ses02F_script03_2_F011	neu	Just seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.
Ses02F_script03_2_M012	fru	You can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on.
Ses02F_script03_2_F012	neu	Well, it's become a habit with you.
Ses02F_script03_2_M013	ang	You needn't be so grand, just because you don't happen to want any yourself at the moment.
Ses02F_script03_2_F013	ang	Don't be so stupid.
Ses02F_script03_2_F014	ang	What?
Ses02F_script03_2_M015	fru	Nothing.
Ses02F_script03_2_F016	exc	A woman's job is to allure the man.  Watch me a minute, will you?
Ses02F_script03_2_F017	fru	No, it isn't.
Ses02F_script03_2_M019	fru	Yes, it is.
Ses02F_script03_2_F018	ang	Oh, be quiet.
Ses02F_script03_2_F019	fru	Doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.
Ses02F_script03_2_M021	fru	Snap, snap, snap, like a little adder.
Ses02F_script03_2_F020	ang	Adders don't snap, they sting.
Ses02F_script03_2_M022	fru	Nonsense.  They have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.
Ses02F_script03_2_M023	fru	They snap.
Ses02F_script03_2_F022	fru	I don't care, do you understand?  I don't care.  I don't care if they bark or roll about like hoops.
Ses02F_script03_2_F024	fru	Mind your own business.
Ses02F_script03_2_F025	ang	You're quite insufferable
Ses02F_script03_2_F026	fru	I expect it's because you're drunk.
Ses02F_script03_2_M027	ang	I'm not in the least drunk.
Ses02F_script03_2_M028	fru	As I mentioned before, I have had three minute liquor glasses of brandy the whole evening long.  A child of two couldn't get drunk on that.
Ses02F_script03_2_F028	fru	On the contrary, a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.
Ses02F_script03_2_M029	fru	Oh, very interesting.  How about a child of four?  A child of six?  Or a child of nine?
Ses02F_script03_2_F029	ang	Shut up.
Ses02F_script03_2_M030	ang	We could get a good debate going about this, don't you think?  Intemperate tots.
Ses02F_script03_2_F030	fru	Not very funny, dear.  You'd better have some more brandy.
Ses02F_script03_2_F031	ang	Why?
Ses02F_script03_2_M033	fru	Because it's late and it'll annoy the people upstairs.
Ses02F_script03_2_F032	fru	There aren't any people upstairs.  It's a photographer's studio.
Ses02F_script03_2_M034	fru	There are people downstairs I suppose?
Ses02F_script03_2_M035	fru	This is no time of the year for Tunis.
Ses02F_script03_2_F034	ang	Turn it on again, please.
Ses02F_script03_2_M036	ang	I'll do no such thing.
Ses02F_script03_2_F035	ang	Very well, if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.
Ses02F_script03_2_M037	ang	Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.
Ses02F_script03_2_F036	ang	You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.
Ses02F_script03_2_M038	ang	Turn it off.
Ses02F_script03_2_F037	ang	Stop it.  Go away.  I hate you.
Ses02F_script03_2_M039	ang	Amanda, listen. listen
Ses02F_script03_2_F038	ang	Listen?  Listen, indeed.  I am sick and tired of listening to you, damn sadistic bully.
Ses02F_script03_2_M040	fru	Very amusing, indeed.
Ses02F_script03_2_F039	ang	I hate you.  Stop it.  Stop it.  I hate you, do you hear?  You're conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.
Ses02F_script03_2_M041	ang	You're a vile, tempered, loose living, wicked little beast and I hope to never see you again as long as I live.
Ses02F_script03_2_F040	ang	This is the end.  Finally and forever.  Do you hear me?  The end.
Ses02F_script03_2_M042	ang	You're not going like this.
Ses02F_script03_2_F041	ang	Oh Yes, I am.
Ses02F_script03_2_M043	ang	You're not.
Ses02F_script03_2_F042	ang	I am.  Let go of me.  You're a cruel fiend and I hate and loathe you.
Ses02F_script03_2_M044	ang	Shut up. Shut up.
Ses02F_script03_2_M045	ang	I wouldn't-- I wouldn't marry--
Ses02F_script03_2_M046	ang	I wouldn't marry you if you came in crawling on your knees
Ses02F_script03_2_F043	ang	Thank God I realized what you are-- I'd never marry you again ever in my life. You're a cruel fiend and I hate you. You're a beast. You're a beast--I hate you. Stop it.  Stop it.
Ses02F_script03_2_M047	ang	You're a evil vampire and I hope to God I never see you again as long as I live.
Ses02M_impro01_M000	fru	All right. Finally. Here you go.
Ses02M_impro01_F000	neu	Hi, How can I help you?
Ses02M_impro01_M001	neu	Yea. I just want to get this done,
Ses02M_impro01_F001	neu	Sure, um
Ses02M_impro01_M002	neu	get my new license.
Ses02M_impro01_F002	neu	do you have two forms of ID with you?
Ses02M_impro01_M003	neu	Um, no, I got my driver's license though.
Ses02M_impro01_F003	neu	I actually need two forms of ID. I need either a passport or a birth certificate, or social security card. I'm sorry.
Ses02M_impro01_M004	neu	Uh, sorry, I forgot them. I mean I've got to -
Ses02M_impro01_F004	neu	Well
Ses02M_impro01_M005	neu	well is the dri-driver's license going to work?
Ses02M_impro01_F005	neu	I- I can take your driver's license but I need another form of ID in order to process this paper work.
Ses02M_impro01_M006	fru	Okay, so what are you saying? What-

Ses02M_impro01_F008	fru	you need to bring two forms of ID there is nothing we can do about it.
Ses02M_impro01_M009	ang	Shouldn't they have like told us about that? I mean why - why would they make me go and wait three hours if I have got to go and do it again?
Ses02M_impro01_F009	fru	Well, it's actually-
Ses02M_impro01_F010	fru	It's standard that you bring a couple of forms of ID, I'm sorry.
Ses02M_impro01_M010	ang	It's standard? I mean I don't work at the D.M.V. how am I supposed to know that, like, I stand in line, I get my

Ses02M_impro01_M011	ang	I filled out the application right, didn't I?
Ses02M_impro01_F012	fru	Yes, you did, thank you very much, but we're not responsible if you've forgotten something, and we need to have two forms of ID.
Ses02M_impro01_M012	fru	Okay. What about - no -- how about you hold that and I'll - I'll go and I can come back-
Ses02M_impro01_F013	fru	I'm sorry, but there is a lot of people waiting so you're just going to have to get in line again.
Ses02M_impro01_M013	fru	I've been waiting for three hours.
Ses02M_impro01_F014	fru	It just happens to people all the time, I'm sorry sir, but I can't make an exception for you.

Ses02M_impro01_M017	fru	That doesn't make any sense. Why?
Ses02M_impro01_F018	fru	I'm sorry, sir. There is nothing I can do.
Ses02M_impro01_M018	ang	You- shouldn't you have like a sign or something maybe like up on the counter when you get the applica- maybe on the application
Ses02M_impro01_F019	fru	Well, if you had checked the web site it would have said.
Ses02M_impro01_F020	fru	If you had checked the website it would have said that you needed two forms of identification.
Ses02M_impro01_M019	ang	What web- I didn't go to a website - why would I need to - it's the D.M.V.. You come to the D.M.V., you wait in line for three hours, and then you go home.
Ses02M_impro01_F021	fru	Well, maybe you should
Ses02M_impro01_M020	fru	I waited in line now I'm ready to get my stuff and then go home.
Ses02M_impro01_F022	fru	Right. So maybe you should go home now and get your paperwork and come back.
Ses02M_impro01_F023	fru	I'm sorry sir but there's a lot of people waiting. So if you won't move out of the way, then I'm going to have to call security.

Ses02M_impro02_F003	sad	but
Ses02M_impro02_M002	sad	and
Ses02M_impro02_F004	sad	It's dangerous; I mean how can you make sure that you'll
Ses02M_impro02_M003	fru	It's- It's dangerous anywhere, honey. I mean this is -this- I'm just going to go and we'll get it over with,
Ses02M_impro02_F005	sad	I hope so.
Ses02M_impro02_F006	sad	I hope so.
Ses02M_impro02_F007	sad	It's going to be really rough.
Ses02M_impro02_M007	sad	You gotta take care of our baby for me, alright?
Ses02M_impro02_F008	sad	I'll send you lots of pictures.

Ses02M_impro02_F010	sad	I mean can't they put you in like, you know kitchen work or something where you won't get
Ses02M_impro02_F011	fru	It doesn't make any sense; I don't know why we have to be at war in the first place.
Ses02M_impro02_M013	sad	there's people that thought it was the right thing to do so now we have to- we have to do what we have to do for our country
Ses02M_impro02_M014	neu	and it'll work out you know, go there and do that. Yeah, I'll be back

Ses02M_impro03_M001	exc	Well, I finally did it
Ses02M_impro03_F001	exc	Finally did what?
Ses02M_impro03_F003	exc	Oh, my Gosh. Well, and did
Ses02M_impro03_F004	exc	Did she say yes?
Ses02M_impro03_M005	exc	Yes, she said yes. [LAUGHTER] I know
Ses02M_impro03_F005	exc	That's like the most definitive.
Ses02M_impro03_F007	exc	I would have thought you would have told me that you were planning on doing this.
Ses02M_impro03_F008	exc	Yea, I guess so. Oh, my Gosh. Was she surprised?
Ses02M_impro03_M008	exc	Yes, yes. You know, she - she was like - I mean, she was happy, you know
Ses02M_impro03_M009	exc	I - I think it was about time, I don't know, maybe. You know what, it's been it's been long enough now.
Ses02M_impro03_M010	hap	Oh, well, it was -- you know, we were at this- at this concert and yeah
Ses02M_impro03_M011	hap	so I-I talked to some of the crew before hand and-
Ses02M_impro03_F011	exc	Oh, You did not.
Ses02M_impro03_M012	hap	I-I did.
Ses02M_impro03_F012	exc	Oh, my Gosh. that's so cute
Ses02M_impro03_F013	exc	That's so romantic. Oh, my Gosh. She must have died. That's like one of those things you write into a magazine about like my boyfriend did this. Oh my God.
Ses02M_impro03_M014	hap	I know, so
Ses02M_impro03_M015	hap	I got to freak her out.
Ses02M_impro03_M016	exc	No, yes -- so
Ses02M_impro03_F014	exc	She must have flipped out.
Ses02M_impro03_M017	hap	Yea, that way she was guaranteed that she could not say no.
Ses02M_impro03_F015	exc	Right exactly because you can't say no in front of thousands of people. [LAUGHTER]
Ses02M_impro03_M018	exc	No, but it was good.
Ses02M_impro03_F016	exc	Did you bring her up on stage too?
Ses02M_impro03_M019	exc	Yes, yes. [LAUGHTER]
Ses02M_impro03_F017	exc	Oh, my Gosh, that's so cute.
Ses02M_impro03_M020	exc	I know it was, I don't know I was really nervous but I'm really - I'm really glad.
Ses02M_impro03_F018	exc	Are your parents excited or...?
Ses02M_impro03_M021	hap	Oh yes, they - they you know they love her and so I mean...
Ses02M_impro03_F020	exc	Ooh, that would be fun.
Ses02M_impro03_M024	exc	Yea, yea, I'm not too sure where yet I guess you know, I kind of got to figure some stuff out here first
Ses02M_impro03_F023	exc	Oh my Gosh. I cannot believe you're getting married, that is so cool.
Ses02M_impro03_M026	exc	I know.
Ses02M_impro03_F024	exc	Golly, it just makes me all like romantic inside, like I really want that to happen to me. [LAUGHTER]
Ses02M_impro03_M027	hap	Oh, it will, obviously you know. But I know it's something - I don't know, you never really think about it happening, like before hand.
Ses02M_impro03_M028	hap	Sure. Oh, yes.
Ses02M_impro03_M030	exc	Yes, well, Thanks, thanks. Thank you. yeah
Ses02M_impro03_F028	exc	Yay, well congratulations, that's so cool. [BREATHING] I can't wait.
Ses02M_impro03_M031	hap	Hah.
Ses02M_impro04_M000	fru	Uhm, I don't know
Ses02M_impro04_F000	neu	So how you feeling?
Ses02M_impro04_M001	fru	I don't know what I'm going to do about this; I mean
Ses02M_impro04_M002	fru	I have got to get a job, you know? Like-
Ses02M_impro04_F001	neu	You've been doing a lot of work for it, right?
Ses02M_impro04_M003	fru	Well, yea you know, I get my resumes and I mean I-
Ses02M_impro04_F002	neu	Right, so the fact you doing the best that you can is -
Ses02M_impro04_M004	fru	I go out all the places I can, every place that'll give an interview you know.
Ses02M_impro04_F003	neu	you know you shouldn't give yourself a hard time for that, it's the best you can.
Ses02M_impro04_M005	fru	But it's been so long, like what - what am I - what am I waiting -- I should probably just do something else, or
Ses02M_impro04_F004	neu	Well, but you care about what you do, right?
Ses02M_impro04_M006	fru	I don't know, I mean why - why
Ses02M_impro04_M007	fru	Yea, but it's - it's almost like it's not worth it you know, if I'm going to waste to have my life like trying to get a job, I mean once I actually do get the job it's like oh, retirement or something. I don't know, you know.
Ses02M_impro04_F005	neu	I understand that it's so frustrating but I know that you're here because you really want it you know and, and uh
Ses02M_impro04_M009	fru	I don't even know if it's going to be worth it because I can't break myself in, you know like I can't - can't even get a foot in the door you know.
Ses02M_impro04_F006	neu	Well, I mean you're still here you've tried for this long so I think that says something all in itself.
Ses02M_impro04_M010	fru	Yea, it says I'm stupid enough to be trying this long and not move on somewhere else.
Ses02M_impro04_F007	neu	You are persistence. I mean that's important. that's
Ses02M_impro04_M011	fru	I mean, I can't- I can't be persistent forever, you know, you can't not have a job forever, you know, I've got- I've got to do something, I've got to make money and get food on the table.
Ses02M_impro04_F008	neu	Well, you're talented so keep that in mind, you know, you shouldn't give yourself too hard of a time.
Ses02M_impro04_M012	fru	I mean, maybe I'm not, you know. I don't have a job. Maybe - maybe I'm not as good as-as I thought I was and
Ses02M_impro04_M013	fru	I just got a whole skewed opinion on just how this is supposed to work out and
Ses02M_impro04_F009	sad	I'm sorry.
Ses02M_impro04_M014	sad	I don't know, it's just not, I don't know - I don't know what to do really, you know, I'm just thinking
Ses02M_impro04_M015	fru	maybe - maybe take up painting, I don't know, you know.
Ses02M_impro04_M016	fru	Do something that I don't have to go out and do something, stay at home, I don't know.
Ses02M_impro04_M017	fru	Seems like the only option at this point because obviously the outer world has just rejected me of all possible employment.
Ses02M_impro04_F010	neu	That's- I mean. There are more factors then just whether you're good or not, you know what I mean like
Ses02M_impro04_F011	neu	and the fact that you know there is always different types of things and what kind of people they want in the office and whether it's male or female or you know what I mean, like things are out of your control.
Ses02M_impro04_F012	neu	So you should take that in consideration rather than giving yourself such a hard time.
Ses02M_impro04_M018	fru	I know, but I mean- if that's the - you know, I'm either like the worst at this or just the most unlucky person on the planet I mean this doesn't
Ses02M_impro04_M019	ang	this doesn't happen to a normal person.
Ses02M_impro04_F014	neu	You know and the fact you still here and still cooking, like it's good that you're thinking about it, that you're reconsidering.
Ses02M_impro04_F015	neu	But like, just because you're considering why it's been so difficult doesn't mean you should just stop.
Ses02M_impro04_M020	fru	I mean, I don't know, I don't see - I don't see any other way - any other way around it right now.
Ses02M_impro04_F016	neu	Maybe you should take a little break from it, but I don't think you should stop.
Ses02M_impro04_M022	sad	Right. Thanks for talking to me.
Ses02M_impro05_M000	neu	Hi. Um-
Ses02M_impro05_F000	neu	Hi, can I help you?
Ses02M_impro05_M001	neu	It seems that uh- my-my bag didn't make it out on the carousel.
Ses02M_impro05_F001	neu	Oh, did you check? Did you make sure as it went around the second time that it-
Ses02M_impro05_M002	neu	Yes, yes, it's gone around like you know twenty times. It's been about a half hour.
Ses02M_impro05_F002	neu	Okay. Well, um- the f.
Ses02M_impro05_F003	neu	Actually I'm looking here at the information, the flight that you were on we had some trouble with some of the baggage, it looks like a few peoples' bags didn't make it through. Um, so-
Ses02M_impro05_M003	neu	Okay. So what-what do I have to get you know
Ses02M_impro05_F004	neu	Well, you can fill out this paperwork um- and if for some reason it shows up, we can bring it to you, but-
Ses02M_impro05_F005	neu	Well, sometimes it's just late baggage or misplaced baggage and it comes out but it seems to be here and just I'm reading off of this that
Ses02M_impro05_F006	neu	Uh- it didn't make it into the second plane so it looks like there - they don't actually know what happened to it.
Ses02M_impro05_F007	neu	Um, well, sometimes there is just difficulties with loading on to the plane. Uh- There can be a theft or uh- some sort of you know mishap with a cart or something.
Ses02M_impro05_M006	fru	I really - I really need that bag.
Ses02M_impro05_F008	neu	I- I- I understand, but um.
Ses02M_impro05_F009	neu	Okay
Ses02M_impro05_M008	fru	I mean -- I've been away for a while and- and now I've- I've gifts for- for you know friends and family I mean, I got stuff in the there
Ses02M_impro05_F010	neu	Right.
Ses02M_impro05_F011	neu	I understand that. Um- So I'm going to put down here that you looking for your baggage, but we actually can't, uh this bag is likely not going to show up so what we're going to do-
Ses02M_impro05_M010	fru	Not going to show - well isn't like - wouldn't it just be at the airport, that, like, if it didn't get on the other plane
Ses02M_impro05_M011	fru	can they check there?
Ses02M_impro05_F012	neu	Sometimes it gets stolen, sometimes it gets misplaced on another plane and
Ses02M_impro05_F013	neu	they - they, it gets shipped to somewhere else and then it's stuck somewhere and then we have no way of tracking that.
Ses02M_impro05_F014	neu	So we'll- what we'll do
Ses02M_impro05_M013	ang	But we have the tags on. I mean like it wouldn't you know, if it got stuck somewhere it's like well this is nobodies bag I mean maybe you know look on the tag and
Ses02M_impro05_M014	fru	see where it came from originally. I mean it seems like-
Ses02M_impro05_F015	neu	Right. Like I said sometimes a theft and things happen like that but we are willing to reim-reimburse you.
Ses02M_impro05_F016	neu	Um, so.
Ses02M_impro05_M016	ang	Theft? Don't you know like all these people that are work - you keep like an eye on them, how can they get away with-
Ses02M_impro05_F017	neu	We have very tight security but we -uh- there are times when we just can't uh make sure there aren't absolutely no human error, you know
Ses02M_impro05_F018	neu	I'm sorry there is no guarantee on baggage.
Ses02M_impro05_M017	fru	This is unbelievable. I've got
Ses02M_impro05_M018	ang	you don't realize the stuff that I've got in that - I really need to get the suitcase okay
Ses02M_impro05_F019	neu	I understand, so-
Ses02M_impro05_M019	fru	so if it's back there or something, if there is something you can do
Ses02M_impro05_M020	fru	I need you to tell me because I really need to get the bag, okay?
Ses02M_impro05_F020	neu	all right, We've already checked back here for your baggage
Ses02M_impro05_F021	neu	and we will continue to look for it and because your paper-
Ses02M_impro05_M021	fru	You've already checked? Can you check again? [garbage]
Ses02M_impro05_F022	fru	I've already looked, thank you very much and because we've filled out paperwork if it shows up we will send it to you but otherwise what we can do is reimburse you for fifty dollar.
Ses02M_impro05_F023	neu	Well, it's- it's just sort of help with the fact uh that you lost some of your possessions and we rather do that than-
Ses02M_impro05_M023	fru	Uh huh, yea, lost some of my possessions, yes, so if I lost maybe a shoe that was in the suitcase and like a carry-on
Ses02M_impro05_M024	fru	that might be like fifty dollars okay, but this - I- [garbage] I had like thousands of dollars worth of stuff in that suitcase.
Ses02M_impro05_F024	neu	The airline can't afford to give you everything that is in that suitcase. and so-
Ses02M_impro05_M025	ang	The a- what? Talking about a core they can't afford it? I mean-
Ses02M_impro05_F025	neu	Well because lots of people get their baggage lost and we don't want to have false claims or anything like that so we have
Ses02M_impro05_F026	neu	we can give you fifty dollar to sort of make up for it, to compensate, and we can definitely let you know if it shows up but likely, more than likely-
Ses02M_impro05_M026	ang	I mean you're not helping me here. What do I have to do here? Do I need to sue the airline company is that what I should do
Ses02M_impro05_M027	fru	because this is ridiculous?
Ses02M_impro05_F028	fru	I don't believe you should sue the airline company but we do have a policy uh- in which we can reimburse you and that's all we can do and I'm sorry I've done everything I can-
Ses02M_impro05_M028	fru	All right. I'm sick- I'm sick of this all right. I'm sick of you and keep your fifty dollar.
Ses02M_impro05_F029	fru	There's other people waiting-
Ses02M_impro06_M000	sad	Kathy died last night.
Ses02M_impro06_M001	sad	yeah, I mean, you know, it was a -
Ses02M_impro06_M002	sad	I guess we saw it coming and she lasted a lot - a lot longer than, uh, they expected but you know, I mean when it actually happens it's just a lot harder.
Ses02M_impro06_F002	sad	It doesn't make any easier, yes.
Ses02M_impro06_M003	sad	I mean at least she was home, she wasn't in the hospital anymore,
Ses02M_impro06_F003	sad	Oh, man. I'm so sorry.
Ses02M_impro06_M004	sad	She was with- yeah  She was with Gary, and he said that she was just sitting there and went to sleep, closed her eyes, and that was it.
Ses02M_impro06_F004	sad	It's going to be so rough, I'm sorry.
Ses02M_impro06_M005	sad	Yes. I mean, it's not as rough on me as it is on him but
Ses02M_impro06_M006	sad	God, it's you know, we've spent so much time with them it's just really surreal, really weird that we're not going to be able to see her anymore and go
Ses02M_impro06_F005	sad	Yeah.
Ses02M_impro06_M007	sad	out to- out to dinner you know and do the troops to California, I mean.
Ses02M_impro06_F006	sad	Totally.
Ses02M_impro06_M008	sad	It's just that- I don't know, it's sort it's sort- of a weird thing you know
Ses02M_impro06_F007	sad	Yeah
Ses02M_impro06_M009	sad	not being able to see anyone again, who knows where they really went, you know. I mean, I guess we can just hope that wherever they are now if it's anywhere that it's better I mean.
Ses02M_impro06_F008	sad	Yes. Well, at least you have a lot of good memories.
Ses02M_impro06_M010	sad	She was [garbage]
Ses02M_impro06_F009	sad	She really cared about you, you know.
Ses02M_impro06_M011	sad	Yes, I mean she cared about all of us. She was great
Ses02M_impro06_M012	sad	so loving everybody you know.
Ses02M_impro06_F010	sad	And she was
Ses02M_impro06_M013	sad	Gosh, I just hate I just hate to see her go.
Ses02M_impro06_F011	sad	Yeah.
Ses02M_impro06_M014	sad	We were all going take a trip to Europe you know.
Ses02M_impro06_F012	sad	Even if you still do she'll- she'll be there.
Ses02M_impro06_M015	sad	Yes.  [BREATHING] God.
Ses02M_impro06_F013	sad	Are you going to be okay?

Ses02M_impro06_M017	sad	just makes it that much harder to deal 'cause as much as you want to, you know, make her better, see her not in any pain, it's like, just I don't know, just has a mind of its own.
Ses02M_impro06_M018	sad	Then she's gone.

Ses02M_impro08_F001	exc	Okay. Before I get into it, um your menu or whatever like where you choose the different thing depending on the-
Ses02M_impro08_F002	exc	it leads you around in circles, you can't, there is no way to like get to a real person if you don't already know how to get to there.
Ses02M_impro08_M002	neu	Right. No, yes I know. It is-It is a little frustrating.
Ses02M_impro08_F003	fru	So is there any way to like bypass that because that is so, like I've been going around in circles
Ses02M_impro08_F004	fru	like press nine, press zero, press back to the menu, like I can't get through to what I'm supposed to get through to.
Ses02M_impro08_M003	neu	I- I'll give you a little hint, next time if it asks if you're on a rotary phone you know, just stay on the line instead of - instead of hitting one or two to say if you're like on a touch tone
Ses02M_impro08_M004	neu	pretend like your on a rotary phone, goes straight through to a person.
Ses02M_impro08_F005	fru	Okay. Oh, that would just make it so much better, 'cause I cannot handle it's just like oh, my God I can't sit here any longer and talk to this lady with this pleasant voice.

Ses02M_impro08_F009	fru	it really freaks me out when I got my bill because it was like I don't -- I didn't spend this. This is not my charge.
Ses02M_impro08_M007	neu	Yea. All right. Well, let me-let me look it up here for a second. Uh, so i think
Ses02M_impro08_F010	neu	Okay, it was um- at the [GARBAGE] sorry, it was at a department store, I think it was Macy's or something
Ses02M_impro08_M008	neu	Okay, Alright, yeah. I- I see it on here.
Ses02M_impro08_F011	fru	and it was like something like eight hundred dollars. I don't remember. It was just a lot and I have thing in front of me right now, but-
Ses02M_impro08_M009	neu	All right. Well, you know that's, that's what we have all of our protection plans for and everything like that so I mean it's
Ses02M_impro08_M010	neu	it- it'll work out fine.

Ses02M_impro08_M016	neu	and it'll get taken off um- no problem you know
Ses02M_impro08_F016	fru	'Cause I-I just don't know how someone could have gotten my charge information
Ses02M_impro08_M017	neu	Right. I mean we might
Ses02M_impro08_M018	neu	Okay.
Ses02M_impro08_M019	neu	Uh, I mean have you been shopping around on the Internet and stuff? I mean that you gave-
Ses02M_impro08_F019	neu	I did buy one thing on ebay I don't know that might-
Ses02M_impro08_M020	neu	Uh-ha, I mean usually sites are pretty well protected but sometimes I mean information gets out, so
Ses02M_impro08_M021	neu	so it is a little a little hard in that situation if you want -- you know you can -um- we can- we can issue another credit card.
Ses02M_impro08_M022	neu	Yeah, yeah. Maybe we'll, uh-
Ses02M_impro08_M023	neu	it's a different number and everything
Ses02M_impro08_M024	neu	Yeah. yeah.
Ses02M_impro08_M025	neu	Yes, um but  for- for that- for that charge we will need you to send something in but we can get you processed immediately for this, for this, for this new card. It still goes to the same address, right?
Ses02M_impro08_M026	neu	Okay. All right. Then we'll get it sent out there. And
Ses02M_impro08_F023	hap	Great.
Ses02M_impro08_M027	neu	And you know just I mean be careful in the future if um
Ses02M_impro08_F024	hap	Yeah.
Ses02M_impro08_M028	neu	if you're ever online or anything like that I mean just make sure it's a secure site and
Ses02M_impro08_M029	neu	and never you know, give it to anyone out, never even give out your number to any like unreliable company that you haven't heard of or anything like that, all right? Because, um, we want to- we definitely want to help you out, but-
Ses02M_impro08_F025	neu	Right, right.

Ses02M_impro08_F030	hap	Thank you very much bye.
Ses02M_script01_1_M003	sad	I don't know. When it cracked he ran into the house and cried in the kitchen.
Ses02M_script01_1_M004	sad	No. I figured it was best to leave him alone.
Ses02M_script01_1_M005	sad	I could hear him right through the floor in my room.
Ses02M_script01_1_M009	fru	You know that Larry is not coming back and I know it. Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?
Ses02M_script01_1_F010	fru	What do you want to do, argue with him?
Ses02M_script01_1_M010	fru	No I don't want to argue with him, but it's about time he realized that nobody believes Larry is alive anymore.
Ses02M_script01_1_M011	fru	Why -- why shouldn't he dream of him? Walk around, waiting for him at night I mean do we contradict him, do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore that we haven't had hope for years now?
Ses02M_script01_1_F011	fru	You can't say that to him.
Ses02M_script01_1_M012	ang	We've got to say it to him.
Ses02M_script01_1_F012	fru	Can you prove it, how can you prove it?
Ses02M_script01_1_M013	ang	For God sakes it's been three years, nobody comes back after three years, that's insane.
Ses02M_script01_1_F013	fru	To you it is and to me. You can talk yourself blue in the face but there is no body and no grave so where are you?
Ses02M_script01_1_M015	fru	All right. All right. Listen to me.
Ses02M_script01_1_M016	neu	You know why I brought Annie here don't you?
Ses02M_script01_1_M017	neu	You know.
Ses02M_script01_1_F015	neu	I got an idea but what's the story?
Ses02M_script01_1_M018	neu	I'm going to ask her to marry me.
Ses02M_script01_1_M019	fru	No it's not only my business.
Ses02M_script01_1_F017	fru	What do you want me to do; you're old enough to know your own mind.
Ses02M_script01_1_M020	fru	So it's all right then I'll go ahead with it?
Ses02M_script01_1_F018	neu	Well, you want to make sure that your father isn't-
Ses02M_script01_1_M021	ang	See it isn't just my business-
Ses02M_script01_1_F019	fru	I'm just saying
Ses02M_script01_1_M023	fru	She's not Larry's girl.
Ses02M_script01_1_F021	neu	From father's point of you he isn't dead and you have no right to take his girl.
Ses02M_script01_1_F022	fru	You can go on from there if you know where to go but I don't know where to go, see I don't know. So what can I do for you?
Ses02M_script01_1_M024	ang	I don't know why but every time I reach out for something that I really want, I have to pull back 'cause someone else will suffer. My whole bloody life, time after time after time.
Ses02M_script01_1_F023	neu	You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong with that.
Ses02M_script01_1_M025	ang	To hell with that.
Ses02M_script01_1_F024	fru	Have you asked Annie yet?
Ses02M_script01_1_M026	neu	I wanted to get this settled first.
Ses02M_script01_1_F025	neu	How do you know she'll marry you? Maybe she feels the same way your father does.
Ses02M_script01_1_M027	neu	Well, if she does then that's the end of it. From her letters I think she's forgotten him.
Ses02M_script01_1_M028	sad	I don't know, I'll find out. Then we'll trash it out with dad, right? Mom, don't avoid me.
Ses02M_script01_1_F026	ang	Trouble is you don't see enough women, you never did.
Ses02M_script01_1_M029	fru	So what I'm not fast with women.
Ses02M_script01_1_F027	ang	I just don't see why it has to be Annie.
Ses02M_script01_1_M030	fru	Because it is.
Ses02M_script01_1_F028	fru	That's a good answer but it doesn't answer anything. I mean you haven't seen her since you went away to war it's five years.
Ses02M_script01_1_M031	fru	I can't help it I know her best. I mean lived next door to her my whole life. These years when I think of a wife, I think of Annie.
Ses02M_script01_1_F029	fru	I don't want a diagram. He thinks he's coming back. Chris, you marry this girl you're pronouncing him dead.
Ses02M_script01_1_F030	fru	Do you know what's going to happen to your father because I don't, see?
Ses02M_script01_1_M035	sad	If I can't do that here well, then I'll have to get out.
Ses02M_script01_1_F032	ang	What the hell is this?
Ses02M_script01_1_M036	sad	I'll get out. I'll get married and go live some place else, maybe New York.
Ses02M_script01_1_F033	ang	What the hell is this, are you crazy?
Ses02M_script01_1_M037	ang	I've been a good son too long a good sucker, I'm through with it.
Ses02M_script01_1_F034	ang	What about the business? What is this?
Ses02M_script01_1_M038	ang	The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.
Ses02M_script01_1_F035	ang	Must you be inspired?
Ses02M_script01_1_M039	ang	Yes, I like it and hour a day. If I'm going to grub for money all day long, at least in the evening I want it beautiful.
Ses02M_script01_1_F036	ang	Tell me, you'd leave the business?
Ses02M_script01_1_M041	sad	Yes, on this I would.
Ses02M_script01_1_F037	ang	Well, you don't want to think like that.
Ses02M_script01_1_M042	fru	Then help me stay here.
Ses02M_script01_1_M043	fru	I know I know mom. All right. Just help me stay here.
Ses02M_script01_1_F039	fru	Just don't go thinking that way.
Ses02M_script01_1_M044	fru	Well, I am thinking that way.
Ses02M_script01_1_F040	fru	I don't understand you, do I?
Ses02M_script01_1_F041	sad	Yea, I can see that.
Ses02M_script01_2_F000	ang	Why did he invite her here?
Ses02M_script01_2_F001	ang	She's been in New York three and half years why all of a sudden-
Ses02M_script01_2_M001	neu	Well, maybe he just wanted to see her again.
Ses02M_script01_2_F002	ang	Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.
Ses02M_script01_2_M002	fru	What do you mean? He lived next door to the girl all his life, why wouldn't he want to see her again?
Ses02M_script01_2_M003	fru	Don't look at me like that, he didn't tell me any more than he told you.
Ses02M_script01_2_F003	ang	He's not going to marry her.
Ses02M_script01_2_M004	neu	How do you know he's even thinking of it?
Ses02M_script01_2_M005	neu	Well, so what?
Ses02M_script01_2_F005	ang	What's going on here Joe?
Ses02M_script01_2_F006	ang	-She's not his girl Joe; she knows she's not.
Ses02M_script01_2_M007	neu	You can't read her mind.
Ses02M_script01_2_F007	fru	Then why is she still single, I mean New York is full of men, why isn't she married? Probably a hundred people told her she's crazy but she's waited.
Ses02M_script01_2_M008	fru	How do you know why she has waited?
Ses02M_script01_2_F008	fru	She knows what I know, that's why. She's faithful as a rock. In my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right.
Ses02M_script01_2_M009	fru	Look it's a nice day, what are we arguing for?
Ses02M_script01_2_F009	fru	Nobody in this house dares take her faith away Joe. Strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.
Ses02M_script01_2_M010	fru	What do you want me to do about it?
Ses02M_script01_2_F010	ang	I want you to act like he's coming back, both of you. Don't you think I haven't noticed since he invited her, I won't stand for any nonsense
Ses02M_script01_2_M011	fru	But Kate
Ses02M_script01_2_F011	fru	Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself. And laugh -- laugh at me but
Ses02M_script01_2_M012	fru	Calm yourself.
Ses02M_script01_2_F013	sad	I need you to believe with me; I can't stand all alone.
Ses02M_script01_2_M013	fru	Calm yourself.
Ses02M_script01_2_F014	fru	Even last week there was a man who showed up in Detroit missing longer than Larry, you read it yourself.
Ses02M_script01_2_M014	fru	All right. All right. Calm yourself.
Ses02M_script01_2_F015	fru	Just you above all need to believe.
Ses02M_script01_2_F016	fru	Don't stop believing.
Ses02M_script01_2_M016	ang	What does that mean, me above all?
Ses02M_script01_2_M017	ang	Look at you -- look at you shaking.
Ses02M_script01_2_F017	fru	I can't help it.
Ses02M_script01_2_M018	fru	What have I got to hide? What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?
Ses02M_script01_3_M000	hap	I know, it went out of style, didn't it?
Ses02M_script01_3_F001	hap	It's all right.  It's a good thing.
Ses02M_script01_3_F002	hap	You know, it's lovely here, the air is sweet.
Ses02M_script01_3_F003	hap	No, not sorry.  But, um. But I'm not gonna stay.
Ses02M_script01_3_M005	fru	The trouble is, I planned on sort of sneaking up on you on a period of a week or so.  But they take it for granted that we're all set.
Ses02M_script01_3_F007	hap	I knew they would, your mother anyway.
Ses02M_script01_3_F008	neu	Well, from her point of view, why else would I come?
Ses02M_script01_3_F009	hap	I guess this is why I came.
Ses02M_script01_3_M010	exc	I'm embarrassing you and I didn't want to tell it to you here.  I wanted some place we'd never been before.  A place where we'd be brand new to each other.
Ses02M_script01_3_F012	hap	Well, you started to write me
Ses02M_script01_3_M014	exc	You felt something that far back?
Ses02M_script01_3_F013	hap	Every day since.
Ses02M_script01_3_M015	exc	Ann, why didn't you let me know?
Ses02M_script01_3_M020	sad	Let's drive someplace.  I want to be alone with you.
Ses02M_script01_3_M021	sad	No.  Nothing like that.
Ses02M_script01_3_F019	sad	Well, what's wrong?  I mean, even in your letters there was some--something ashamed.
Ses02M_script01_3_M022	sad	Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me.
Ses02M_script01_3_F021	sad	It wouldn't work this way.
Ses02M_script01_3_M025	sad	Well, I lost them.
Ses02M_script01_3_M026	sad	Just about all.
Ses02M_script01_3_M027	sad	It takes some time for a guy to toss that off.  'Cause they weren't just men.
Ses02M_script01_3_M028	sad	For instance, this one time, it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.  I put them in pocket.  It's only a little thing, but those are the kind of guys I had.
Ses02M_script01_3_M029	sad	They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  I mean, a little more selfish and they'd have been here today.
Ses02M_script01_3_M030	sad	I got this idea watching 'em go down.  Everything was being destroyed, see, but it seemed that one new thing was made.  A sort of responsibility.  Man for man. You know what I mean?
Ses02M_script01_3_M031	sad	To show that, to bring that onto the Earth again, like some kind of monument and everyone can feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him.
Ses02M_script01_3_M032	sad	Then I came back and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here. I mean, the whole thing to them seemed like it's sort of a bus accident.  I went to work with Dad and that rat race again.
Ses02M_script01_3_M033	sad	And I felt what you said, ashamed somehow 'cause nobody had changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book, drive the new car, see the new refrigerator.
Ses02M_script01_3_M034	sad	I mean, you can take those things out of a war, but when you drive that car, you've gotta realize that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've gotta be a little better because of it.
Ses02M_script01_3_M035	sad	Otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it.  And I didn't want to take any of that.  And I guess that included you.
Ses02M_script01_3_F025	sad	Do you still feel that way?
Ses02M_script01_3_M036	neu	I want you now Annie.
Ses02M_script01_3_F026	sad	'Cause you mustn't feel that way.  Because you have a right to everything you have, Chris.  Everything, you understand that?  Me too.
Ses02M_script01_3_F027	sad	I mean, and your money, there's- there's nothing wrong with your money.  I mean, your father put hundreds of planes in the air.  A man should be paid for that.
Ses02M_script01_3_F028	hap	What'll I do with a fortune?
Ses02M_script02_1_M000	exc	What time is it? They're supposed to run around midnight.
Ses02M_script02_1_M001	exc	God, this great, isn't it? Like look at the night we go here, it couldn't be better.
Ses02M_script02_1_M003	exc	How you doing?
Ses02M_script02_1_F000	neu	Fine.
Ses02M_script02_1_M004	exc	Is that -- is that, no? Was that just foam? I can't even tell.
Ses02M_script02_1_M005	exc	Although, I guess you can't tell it probably isn't them. Probably be unmistakable don't you think?
Ses02M_script02_1_M006	exc	How you doing? You know what I forgot? I forgot to bring my flashlight. How - how could I forget to bring my flashlight? How could I be so stupid?
Ses02M_script02_1_F001	neu	What flashlight?
Ses02M_script02_1_M007	fru	You know the flashlight, the silver one, there is only one, isn't there?
Ses02M_script02_1_F002	fru	That's not your flashlight.
Ses02M_script02_1_M008	fru	Who's is it?
Ses02M_script02_1_F003	fru	It's ours; it's mine too.
Ses02M_script02_1_F004	fru	But you kept saying my flashlight as if somehow it's just yours. I mean how is it supposed to make me feel?
Ses02M_script02_1_F005	neu	Yea.
Ses02M_script02_1_M013	exc	You cold, you want my jacket? We should've - we should've brought our blanket, our blanket, how could we forget to bring the blanket?
Ses02M_script02_1_M014	exc	Oh, a six-pack, that's, should've brought a -- a six-pack be just the ticket right now. How could I forget,
Ses02M_script02_1_M015	exc	oh man. Like a kid, it's amazing I got out of the house with my fly zipped.
Ses02M_script02_1_M016	exc	You think they can hear us talk or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around?
Ses02M_script02_1_F006	neu	I'm cold.
Ses02M_script02_1_F007	fru	It's after eleven. Let's just go home.
Ses02M_script02_1_M018	fru	Are you kidding, we'd miss it. We, we just got here. What's the point in coming down here if we just turn around and go home?
Ses02M_script02_1_F008	fru	There is no point in coming down here.
Ses02M_script02_1_F009	fru	That's my point.
Ses02M_script02_1_F010	fru	So let's go.
Ses02M_script02_1_F011	neu	Not particularly.
Ses02M_script02_1_F012	fru	I don't, it's just stupid.
Ses02M_script02_1_M023	exc	Honey, this is a natural phenomenon. I mean it only happens once a year.
Ses02M_script02_1_M024	exc	Think about the people in Kansas, they- they'd have to get a plane ticket and hotel reservations to see this. We live forty minutes away it's too good to pass up.
Ses02M_script02_1_F013	fru	Pass up what? These little fish swim onto the beach flop around and swim away, and then they die.
Ses02M_script02_1_M025	exc	Yea, but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives. I mean all that flopping is laying eggs or what do you, mating or spotting or something like that.
Ses02M_script02_1_M026	exc	This is a big night for these guys, life's last orgy.
Ses02M_script02_1_F014	fru	What are you so excited about? I mean it's not a moon landing we're talking about here it's fish. It's a fish nobody even eats.
Ses02M_script02_1_M027	fru	Yes they do.
Ses02M_script02_1_F015	fru	Augie
Ses02M_script02_1_M028	exc	Okay. But it's fish that do something none of the other fish do. Like the swallows returning to Capistrano, or the Lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs
Ses02M_script02_1_M029	exc	you know there is like, there is a certain mystery here, a magic, a bit of the unexplainable. I don't see how you cannot be interested.
Ses02M_script02_1_F016	sad	I'm just not.
Ses02M_script02_1_F017	neu	Yes.
Ses02M_script02_1_M032	fru	And then last year I remember specifically you were so excited that you stubbed your toe on the way pushing me out of the house, and you didn't even notice until we got in the car.
Ses02M_script02_1_F018	ang	Last year you'll also remember our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got into a big fight over nothing, and we didn't see the Grunions.
Ses02M_script02_1_F019	fru	We didn't see them the first time either.
Ses02M_script02_1_M034	fru	We just weren't in a good spot; this is a much better spot. I've got good instincts for these things.
Ses02M_script02_1_M035	exc	There is that, oh no that's just seaweed, isn't it?
Ses02M_script02_1_M036	exc	This is, this is great, isn't it? I wouldn't miss this for anything. Now listen to this, I know you're not interested but just listen.
Ses02M_script02_1_M037	exc	Out there somewhere there is this huge mass of silver fish headed this way,
Ses02M_script02_1_M038	exc	they don't why, we don't know why. They didn't take a vote or anything; they didn't get a map or an invitation.
Ses02M_script02_1_M039	exc	Just all as one. This little time sensitive firecracker, instinctual firecracker in their body just went off and all as one they turned and formed a line as long the California coast and started swimming. They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters.
Ses02M_script02_1_M040	exc	It's single mindedness, with no mind, it's urgency that's pure urge, they don't know what drives them. They don't ask it a name or ask it a question,
Ses02M_script02_1_M041	exc	they just turn as one and start the swim and brings them right here to this spot where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death.
Ses02M_script02_1_M042	exc	Look at me; I'm giving myself goose bumps all my hairs are popping up.
Ses02M_script02_1_F020	neu	That's the wind.
Ses02M_script02_1_F021	neu	About what?
Ses02M_script02_1_F022	fru	It's ridiculous.
Ses02M_script02_2_M000	neu	So what do you think?
Ses02M_script02_2_M001	neu	What I was saying.
Ses02M_script02_2_F001	fru	It's ridiculous.
Ses02M_script02_2_M002	neu	Certainly it's not. Slightly exaggerated scientific fact.
Ses02M_script02_2_M005	fru	Carla, can I ask you something? Don't take this wrong but are you having your period?
Ses02M_script02_2_F005	ang	Goddamn it Augie don't ask me that. I hate it when you ask me that. You always ask me that. It's insulting.
Ses02M_script02_2_M006	fru	Well, what's bugging you?
Ses02M_script02_2_F006	ang	We just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.
Ses02M_script02_2_M007	fru	There is nothing to it, we come here, the Grunion arrive, then do their little fish business, we go oh ah look, they go home, we go home.
Ses02M_script02_2_F007	fru	For heavens sake we are not going to see the Grunions.
Ses02M_script02_2_M008	fru	Why not?
Ses02M_script02_2_F008	fru	We never do, do we? I mean have we ever?
Ses02M_script02_2_M009	fru	We've missed them twice; that's not ever.
Ses02M_script02_2_F009	fru	Twice is every time we've tried, that's ever.
Ses02M_script02_2_M010	neu	Well, we'll see them this year.
Ses02M_script02_2_F010	fru	No we won't; it's pointless. It's like waiting up to see Santa Claus,
Ses02M_script02_2_F011	ang	I mean I feel like my whole life is going to be spent standing on the beach waiting for the fish to show up with my eyes open and my hands clasped expectantly and the fish won't show up.
Ses02M_script02_2_M011	fru	I thought you wanted to see them.
Ses02M_script02_2_F012	fru	You don't understand anything I'm saying.
Ses02M_script02_2_M012	fru	No of course not.
Ses02M_script02_2_F013	ang	I did want to see them, I always do. I mean I keep thinking that this is going to be the time and it never is.
Ses02M_script02_2_F014	fru	For heavens sake this isn't about fish.
Ses02M_script02_2_M014	fru	All right. I've been trying to work this backwards but I cannot seem to pinpoint the moment that we took a turn for the worst.
Ses02M_script02_2_M015	neu	You were fine during the phone call from Marge, dinner was okay, doing the dishes was no problem, let's see, I took a shower, you watched the news, you said
Ses02M_script02_2_M016	neu	"the Grunion are running tonight," I said "great, let's go, I feel lucky,"
Ses02M_script02_2_M017	neu	okay so I'm getting on my jacket and putting out the animals, getting the car out of the garage-
Ses02M_script02_2_F015	sad	Do you remember the first time we came to see it? It was about four years ago right after we got married.
Ses02M_script02_2_F016	sad	We thought I was pregnant and we opened a bottle of champagne but no glasses, you asked me to dance, we kicked off our shoes and you popped the cork.
Ses02M_script02_2_F017	sad	And when we were dancing you said the softest most intimate things to me right into my ears so I could feel them as much as hear them
Ses02M_script02_2_F018	sad	and I remember thinking that this is it you know. At last, at last I am as happy as I am supposed to be
Ses02M_script02_2_F019	sad	Just dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.
Ses02M_script02_2_M019	exc	It was in the car, right? Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker you said, let's get some champagne and I said times are wasting or something like that, right?
Ses02M_script02_2_M020	exc	Of course, I see it now; you want this to be like that other time, right? That's it, right?
Ses02M_script02_2_F020	sad	I'd rather not remember some things. I would rather not hope for some things.
Ses02M_script02_2_M021	neu	Yea. Okay, sure, no. I see. Listen, you want to dance?
Ses02M_script02_2_F021	sad	No.
Ses02M_script02_2_M022	neu	You want to go get some champagne?
Ses02M_script02_2_F022	sad	No.
Ses02M_script02_2_M023	neu	Take off our shoes?
Ses02M_script02_2_M025	neu	Get married again?
Ses02M_script02_2_F025	fru	No.
Ses02M_script02_2_M026	fru	What? What? You want a divorce?
Ses02M_script02_2_F026	fru	No.
Ses02M_script02_2_M027	fru	A vacation?
Ses02M_script02_2_F027	fru	No.
Ses02M_script02_2_M028	fru	A new carpet? A poodle, a ice cream, backrub, a suicide pact, what, what Carla, what the hell do you want?
Ses02M_script02_2_F028	fru	I want something to turn out the way that it supposed to.
Ses02M_script02_2_M029	ang	Well welcome to the human race, all right. Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed? You think I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish?
Ses02M_script02_2_M031	fru	No, no, just like you I thought it was going to be all like peaches and roses and sand in our toes, and wind in our hair, and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'll have three, fat, rosy kids and ha-ha baby the joke is on us
Ses02M_script02_2_M032	fru	'cause you know what you get Carla, you know what you get? This.
Ses02M_script02_2_F029	fru	This? What, what is this? This isn't even anything.
Ses02M_script02_2_F030	fru	I'm sure, this is standing on the beach, this is waiting, this is fighting.
Ses02M_script02_2_F031	sad	Well, but this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.
Ses02M_script02_2_M035	sad	No, I know. Me neither.
Ses02M_script02_2_F032	fru	I mean it's -- this is just this. I mean it includes a lot and everything but isn't something else. Do you have any idea what I'm trying to say?
Ses02M_script02_2_F034	sad	I know that you meant this to be special and nice, and there's the sand and the moon and everything but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.
Ses02M_script02_2_M037	sad	Maybe if you were with somebody else too.
Ses02M_script02_2_M038	sad	No, I know. But still, I know I don't make you happy.
Ses02M_script02_2_F037	hap	Don't be ridiculous. I mean don't you know that?
Ses02M_script02_2_F038	sad	You're the one who probably wishes he was with someone else, someone who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard.
Ses02M_script02_2_M040	hap	Now that you mention it. No, I don't.
Ses02M_script02_2_M041	hap	I don't know it seemed like a pretty good spot to me. Look at the moon - view the moon view I got from here.
Ses02M_script02_2_M042	hap	What have we got here?
Ses02M_script02_2_F042	hap	Well, I guess we don't need glasses.
Ses02M_script02_2_F044	sad	Augie, I'm sorry.
Ses02M_script02_2_M045	hap	Shh, if we're very quiet the fish might come.
Ses02M_script02_2_F045	hap	Or not.
Ses02M_script02_2_M046	hap	Or not.
Ses02M_script03_1_F002	exc	What are we going to do?
Ses02M_script03_1_F003	hap	Now and always sweet.
Ses02M_script03_1_M005	exc	Hello? Hello? What? Wrong number.
Ses02M_script03_1_F005	exc	Oh. It sends shivers down my spine.
Ses02M_script03_1_F006	hap	Behave exquisitely.
Ses02M_script03_1_M007	hap	With the most perfect poise.
Ses02M_script03_1_F007	hap	Yes, I should probably to a court curtsey.
Ses02M_script03_1_M008	hap	Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's is happy, do they?
Ses02M_script03_1_M009	sad	Oh darling don't say that.
Ses02M_script03_1_M010	hap	Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing love?
Ses02M_script03_1_M011	hap	What does it all mean that's what I ask- that's what I ask myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth?  Good God what does it all mean?
Ses02M_script03_1_M012	exc	You mustn't be serious my dear one, that's just what they want.
Ses02M_script03_1_F012	exc	Who's they?
Ses02M_script03_1_M014	exc	flippancy brings out the acid in their damned sweetness in light.
Ses02M_script03_1_M015	exc	Certainly you must, we figures of fun all right.
Ses02M_script03_1_M016	sad	No, that desire will fade along with our passion.
Ses02M_script03_1_F015	sad	Oh dear, should we like that?
Ses02M_script03_1_M018	exc	Yes, yes, with all his might.
Ses02M_script03_1_M019	exc	No, no it isn't, death is very laughable, such a cunning little mystery, all done with mirrors.
Ses02M_script03_1_M020	exc	So is everyone else in the long run.
Ses02M_script03_1_M021	exc	Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers, let's blow our trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as much as we can. Like quite idiotic, very small, school children. Let's savor the delight of the moment.
Ses02M_script03_1_M022	exc	Come kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.
Ses02M_script03_1_M024	hap	You remember that awful scene we had in Venice?
Ses02M_script03_1_F021	hap	Which particular one?
Ses02M_script03_1_F022	hap	Oh Charles, that was his name Charles. It did wiggle so beautifully.
Ses02M_script03_1_F023	hap	I know you did. You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal; I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.
Ses02M_script03_1_F024	hap	It went on intermittently for days.
Ses02M_script03_1_F025	hap	It burned my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.
Ses02M_script03_1_M029	hap	That was a rouser, wasn't it?
Ses02M_script03_1_F027	hap	The manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor biting and scratching like panthers.
Ses02M_script03_1_M031	hap	I'll never forget his face.
Ses02M_script03_1_F028	hap	Oh it was ridiculous, completely ridiculous.
Ses02M_script03_1_F029	hap	And very much sillier.
Ses02M_script03_2_M000	neu	As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.
Ses02M_script03_2_F000	exc	You knew there was nothing in that.
Ses02M_script03_2_M001	ang	I knew nothing of the sort. You took presents from him.
Ses02M_script03_2_F001	exc	Presents, just a trivial little broach.
Ses02M_script03_2_F002	neu	No it wasn't. It was very pretty I still have it and I wear it often.
Ses02M_script03_2_M003	ang	You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.
Ses02M_script03_2_F003	neu	No I didn't, you worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.
Ses02M_script03_2_M005	ang	You let him kiss you; you said you did.
Ses02M_script03_2_F005	neu	What of it?
Ses02M_script03_2_F006	neu	It gave him a lot of pleasure, it didn't hurt me any.
Ses02M_script03_2_M007	ang	What about me?
Ses02M_script03_2_F007	neu	Well, if you hadn't been so nosey and suspicious you never wouldn't have known anything about it.
Ses02M_script03_2_F008	fru	I'm bored of this conversation.
Ses02M_script03_2_F009	neu	No thanks.
Ses02M_script03_2_M010	neu	I have a little I think.
Ses02M_script03_2_M011	neu	No particular reason. Anyhow, they are very small ones.
Ses02M_script03_2_F011	neu	It just seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.
Ses02M_script03_2_M012	neu	You can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on.
Ses02M_script03_2_F012	neu	Well, it's become a habit with you.
Ses02M_script03_2_F014	ang	What?
Ses02M_script03_2_M015	fru	Nothing.
Ses02M_script03_2_F015	neu	No I'm just making myself fascinating for you.
Ses02M_script03_2_M016	neu	Going out somewhere, dear?
Ses02M_script03_2_M018	neu	As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true.
Ses02M_script03_2_F018	fru	Oh, no it isn't.
Ses02M_script03_2_F019	ang	Be quiet.
Ses02M_script03_2_M021	fru	Snap, snap, snap, like a little adder.
Ses02M_script03_2_M022	fru	Oh nonsense they have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.
Ses02M_script03_2_M023	fru	They snap.
Ses02M_script03_2_F023	ang	I don't care. Do you understand? I don't care. I don't care if they bark or roll about like hoops.
Ses02M_script03_2_M024	neu	Tell me, did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?
Ses02M_script03_2_F024	neu	Yes, I did quite a lot.
Ses02M_script03_2_M026	ang	What riotous time you must have had.
Ses02M_script03_2_M027	ang	No restraint at all, very enjoyable, never had much anyhow.
Ses02M_script03_2_F028	ang	Oh be quiet.
Ses02M_script03_2_M031	ang	We can get a good little debate going about that, don't you think? Intemperate tots.
Ses02M_script03_2_M032	neu	All right. I will.
Ses02M_script03_2_M033	neu	Better turn that off I think.
Ses02M_script03_2_M037	fru	I'll do no such thing.
Ses02M_script03_2_F034	fru	Very well, if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.
Ses02M_script03_2_F035	ang	You are far too temperamental. Try to control yourself.
Ses02M_script03_2_M039	ang	Turn it off.
Ses02M_script03_2_F036	ang	Stop it. Stop it. I hate you.
Ses02M_script03_2_M040	ang	Amanda, listen. Listen.
Ses02M_script03_2_F037	ang	Listen indeed. I'm sick and tired of listening to you, damn sadistic bully.
Ses02M_script03_2_M041	ang	Very amusing indeed.
Ses02M_script03_2_F038	ang	Stop it. Stop it. I hate you, do you hear? You're overbearing and conceited and utterly impossible.
Ses02M_script03_2_M042	ang	You're a vile tempered, loose living, wicked little beast and I hope I never see you again as long as I live.
Ses02M_script03_2_F039	ang	This is the end, do you hear? The end finally and forever.
Ses02M_script03_2_M043	ang	You're not going like this.

Ses03F_impro08_F014	neu	And we will probably send you a calling card.  I'm very sorry.  You're just going to have to be patient, sir.
Ses03F_impro08_M015	ang	Okay, I need more than this.  Are you going to give me a little bit more?
Ses03F_impro08_F015	neu	No, we don't just give you things.  We're- we're-
Ses03F_impro08_F016	neu	we compensating you for all your-
Ses03F_impro08_M016	fru	So you take things from me and you expect me just to wait around.
Ses03F_impro08_F017	fru	No no, we're not taking anything from you sir.  This is- This is unbeknownst to us.  The problem had just happened.
Ses03F_impro08_F018	fru	The satellite-is down in your area.

Ses03F_impro08_F019	fru	No, three days, sir.  It's not three days. It's- It's only been about a day now. Let's not exaggerate.
Ses03F_impro08_M018	fru	No, it's been--three days.
Ses03F_impro08_M019	fru	Fine, it's been a day.  Okay?
Ses03F_impro08_F020	neu	Three days?
Ses03F_impro08_F021	neu	A day?
Ses03F_impro08_F022	neu	I don't know, sir.
Ses03F_impro08_M021	neu	About three million dollars.
Ses03F_impro08_F023	neu	Oh, well, I'm sorry about that. Umm- We-
Ses03F_impro08_F024	neu	Well, ten hours worth of minutes--
Ses03F_impro08_F025	neu	is what's going to happen.
Ses03F_impro08_F026	neu	Sir,
Ses03F_impro08_F027	neu	what I would like what I'm advising you to do now is just to write down all of your problems that you-you feel that--You know, haven't been addressed, fax it to us-
Ses03F_impro08_M026	fru	Oh, my God.
Ses03F_impro08_F028	neu	and we will take care of it if anything happens.  But all we can do now is ask for your patience.
Ses03F_impro08_F029	neu	Okay? Thank you for calling.  Goodbye.
Ses03F_script01_1_M000	neu	He saw it.
Ses03F_script01_1_M001	neu	He was out there when it happened.
Ses03F_script01_1_M002	neu	Um, about four this morning. Uh- I heard a crack and I looked out and I saw him standing there.
Ses03F_script01_1_M003	neu	I don't know. But after it cracked he went back in the house and he cried in the kitchen.
Ses03F_script01_1_F004	neu	Did you talk to him?
Ses03F_script01_1_M004	neu	No, I uh-, I figured the best thing to do was to leave him alone.
Ses03F_script01_1_F005	neu	He cried hard, huh?
Ses03F_script01_1_M005	neu	I could hear it right through the floor.
Ses03F_script01_1_M006	neu	I guess he is.
Ses03F_script01_1_F007	neu	Could he-he's acting just like he did after he died, you know?
Ses03F_script01_1_M007	neu	I don't know.
Ses03F_script01_1_M008	neu	But I know one thing, mom. We've made a terrible mistake with dad.
Ses03F_script01_1_M009	neu	Being dishonest with him. That kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.
Ses03F_script01_1_F010	neu	What do you mean, dishonest?
Ses03F_script01_1_F011	fru	What, you're going to argue with him?
Ses03F_script01_1_M011	fru	No, I don't want to argue with him, but it's time that he realized that no one believes that Larry's coming back anymore.
Ses03F_script01_1_F012	fru	You can't tell him that.
Ses03F_script01_1_M012	fru	We got to tell him that.
Ses03F_script01_1_F013	fru	We can't. It just won't work.
Ses03F_script01_1_M013	fru	You know, for God's sakes it's been three years. No one comes back after three years. It's insane.
Ses03F_script01_1_F014	neu	They do come back.
Ses03F_script01_1_M014	fru	All right. Just- Sit down, mom. I want to talk to you.
Ses03F_script01_1_F017	ang	It's those Goddamn newspapers, you know? I mean, it's like every day they come out with this new person that comes along. And the next one's going to be Larry.
Ses03F_script01_1_M015	fru	All right. All right. Just come on, sit down.
Ses03F_script01_1_F018	fru	What?
Ses03F_script01_1_M016	neu	You know-you know why I asked Annie here, right?
Ses03F_script01_1_F019	neu	Why?
Ses03F_script01_1_M017	neu	You know.
Ses03F_script01_1_M018	neu	I want to ask her to marry me.
Ses03F_script01_1_F021	neu	Well, that's only your business, Chris.
Ses03F_script01_1_M019	fru	Come on, you know that's not only my business.
Ses03F_script01_1_F022	fru	Well, it is. I mean, what do you want me to do? You're grown up; you know what's going on in your mind.
Ses03F_script01_1_M020	neu	So it's all right. I'll just go ahead with it.
Ses03F_script01_1_F023	fru	Well, you better make sure your father's not- No- I'm just saying.
Ses03F_script01_1_M021	ang	See, then it's not just my business. God, you have
Ses03F_script01_1_M022	ang	-Oh, you infuriate me sometimes. You know, it's not just my business too if dad throws a fit.
Ses03F_script01_1_F024	fru	Yeah, well I ignore what I got to ignore.
Ses03F_script01_1_F025	fru	And she-she's Larry's girl.
Ses03F_script01_1_F026	fru	Well, from your father's point of view she is. I mean, he's still alive. You've got no right to take her.
Ses03F_script01_1_F028	fru	'Cause listen, I'm telling you, I don't know where to go from there. Do you?
Ses03F_script01_1_F029	fru	What do you want from me?
Ses03F_script01_1_M026	sad	Every time I reach out for something I have to pull back because other people will suffer. My whole entire life, time and time after time.
Ses03F_script01_1_F030	neu	You're a considerate fella and there's nothing wrong in that.
Ses03F_script01_1_M027	ang	To hell with that.
Ses03F_script01_1_F031	neu	There's nothing wrong with it.
Ses03F_script01_1_M028	neu	I didn't ask Annie yet.
Ses03F_script01_1_F032	fru	You didn't ask her yet?
Ses03F_script01_1_M029	neu	I wanted to get this settled first.
Ses03F_script01_1_M030	neu	Well then I guess it's over then. But from her letters I think she's forgotten him.
Ses03F_script01_1_M031	neu	I'll find out. But then after it's all over we'll thrash it out with dad, right?
Ses03F_script01_1_M032	fru	Mom, don't avoid me.
Ses03F_script01_1_F034	fru	You know, the trouble is you've never had enough women. No, you never did.
Ses03F_script01_1_M033	fru	So what? I'm not fast with women.
Ses03F_script01_1_F035	fru	I don't understand why it has to be her.
Ses03F_script01_1_M034	neu	Because it is.
Ses03F_script01_1_F036	fru	That's a good answer, but it doesn't answer anything.
Ses03F_script01_1_M035	fru	I just-
Ses03F_script01_1_F037	fru	I mean, you haven't seen her since the war. I mean, it's been five years.
Ses03F_script01_1_M036	neu	It just is. I-
Ses03F_script01_1_M037	fru	I grew up with her. Okay. All these years, when I think of someone I want to be my wife I think of Annie. What do you want, a diagram?
Ses03F_script01_1_F038	fru	No, I don't want a diagram.
Ses03F_script01_1_F039	fru	He thinks he's coming back. You go-go on and marry her, I mean, you're pronouncing her dead. And what's going to happen to your father, huh? I don't know. Do you?
Ses03F_script01_1_M038	fru	Okay. All right, then.
Ses03F_script01_1_F040	fru	Just, listen. Give it more thought, is all.
Ses03F_script01_1_M039	fru	No, I've given it three years of thought.
Ses03F_script01_1_M041	neu	But if I can't have that here then I'll get out.
Ses03F_script01_1_M042	neu	I'll get out. I'll marry her somewhere else. Maybe New York.
Ses03F_script01_1_F043	fru	You're what-you're going to leave the business? But you can't do that. What the hell is this?
Ses03F_script01_1_M044	fru	The business. The business doesn't inspire me.
Ses03F_script01_1_F044	fru	Oh, you have to be inspired.
Ses03F_script01_1_M045	ang	Yes. I like it an hour out of the day. If I have to grub for money all day long at least that evening I want it beautiful. I want a wife. I want a family. I want some kids. I want to build something I can give myself to.
Ses03F_script01_1_M046	ang	Now, Annie's in the middle of all that.
Ses03F_script01_1_M047	neu	Now, where do I find it?
Ses03F_script01_1_F045	neu	Tell me something.
Ses03F_script01_1_F046	neu	You'd leave that business.
Ses03F_script01_1_M048	neu	Yes. On this I would.
Ses03F_script01_1_F047	fru	You can't do that.
Ses03F_script01_1_M049	neu	Then help me stay here.
Ses03F_script01_1_F048	fru	All right, but you can't do that. You can't talk like that.
Ses03F_script01_1_M050	neu	Okay. Just-
Ses03F_script01_1_F049	fru	We've worked all our lives for you. Only for you, Chris. The whole shootin' match is for you.
Ses03F_script01_1_M051	fru	Yeah, I know, I know, just help me stay here, all right?
Ses03F_script01_1_F050	neu	I'm going to.
Ses03F_script01_1_M052	neu	I am thinking like that.
Ses03F_script01_1_F052	neu	I don't know you, do I?
Ses03F_script01_1_M053	neu	No, you don't. I'm a pretty tough guy.
Ses03F_script01_1_F053	neu	Yeah. I can see that.
Ses03F_script01_2_F000	ang	Why did you invite her here?
Ses03F_script01_2_F001	ang	She's been in New York for three-and-a-half years. She don't just suddenly come and-
Ses03F_script01_2_M001	neu	Well, maybe, maybe he just wanted to see her.
Ses03F_script01_2_F002	ang	You don't travel seven hundred miles just to see.
Ses03F_script01_2_M003	neu	How do you know he's even thinking about it?
Ses03F_script01_2_F004	ang	It's got that about it.
Ses03F_script01_2_M004	neu	Well, so what?
Ses03F_script01_2_M005	fru	Listen, kid-
Ses03F_script01_2_F006	ang	She's not Larry's girl. She knows that.
Ses03F_script01_2_M006	neu	You can't read her mind.
Ses03F_script01_2_M007	neu	How do you know why she's waited?
Ses03F_script01_2_F011	sad	She's faithful as a rock, don't you know. In my worst moments I can think of her-
Ses03F_script01_2_M008	neu	Look, it's a nice day. What are we arguing for?
Ses03F_script01_2_F013	ang	Nobody in my house better ever dare-dare to challenge her faith. Maybe strangers, but not his father, not his brother.
Ses03F_script01_2_M009	neu	Calm yourself.
Ses03F_script01_2_M010	fru	Calm yourself.
Ses03F_script01_2_F015	ang	Don't, don't laugh at me, don't laugh at me.
Ses03F_script01_2_F016	ang	Look at it. Because why, when she came here and she slept in his room, the memorial broke into pieces. Look at it, look at it, Joe.
Ses03F_script01_2_M011	ang	All right. All right. Calm yourself.
Ses03F_script01_2_M012	fru	Okay. Just calm yourself.
Ses03F_script01_2_F018	sad	No, you've got to believe.
Ses03F_script01_2_M013	ang	Why me, above all?
Ses03F_script01_2_M014	ang	Huh?
Ses03F_script01_2_M015	ang	Why me above all?
Ses03F_script01_2_F020	sad	You got to keep believing.
Ses03F_script01_2_M016	ang	Look at you, you're shaking.
Ses03F_script01_2_F021	sad	I can't help it.
Ses03F_script01_2_M017	ang	What have I got to hide?
Ses03F_script01_2_M018	ang	Huh? What the hell's the matter with you, Kate?
Ses03F_script01_3_F000	hap	You're the only one I know that still loves his parents.
Ses03F_script01_3_M000	hap	Yeah. I know. It went out of style, didn't it?
Ses03F_script01_3_F001	hap	No, it's all right. There's nothing wrong in that, you know.
Ses03F_script01_3_F002	hap	It's really lovely here. The air is sweet.
Ses03F_script01_3_M001	neu	You're not sorry you came?
Ses03F_script01_3_F003	sad	No. I'm not sorry. It's-
Ses03F_script01_3_F005	fru	Well, for one thing, your mother so much has told me to go. [LAUGHTER].
Ses03F_script01_3_M003	neu	Well-
Ses03F_script01_3_M004	neu	What?
Ses03F_script01_3_F008	sad	Well, you've been embarrassed ever since I came.
Ses03F_script01_3_M006	hap	Oh look, um, well, the thing is, I was planning on, planning on sort of sneaking up on you over a week or so, and they-they take it for granted we're all set.
Ses03F_script01_3_M009	hap	I, I guess that's why I asked you to come.
Ses03F_script01_3_F011	hap	Well, I mean,
Ses03F_script01_3_M010	hap	Oh, Annie.
Ses03F_script01_3_F012	hap	from her opinion, why else would I come here?
Ses03F_script01_3_M011	hap	Annie, I love you.
Ses03F_script01_3_M012	hap	I love you a great deal.
Ses03F_script01_3_M013	hap	I-I love you. I have no imagination. That's all I know how to tell it.
Ses03F_script01_3_F013	hap	Well, I guess that's why I came.
Ses03F_script01_3_M014	hap	I'm embarrassing you. I didn't want to tell you it here. I wanted to go somewhere that would be brand-new to each other. It feels wrong here, don't you? This yard and this chair.
Ses03F_script01_3_M015	hap	I don't want to win you from anybody. I want you to be ready for me.
Ses03F_script01_3_F014	hap	I've been ready for a long, long time.
Ses03F_script01_3_M018	hap	You felt something that far back?
Ses03F_script01_3_F018	hap	Every day since.
Ses03F_script01_3_M019	hap	Why didn't you let me know?
Ses03F_script01_3_M020	hap	Give me a kiss, Annie.
Ses03F_script01_3_M021	hap	Give me-
Ses03F_script01_3_F021	hap	I don't know if I ever can forgive you for that. Why'd you wait so long? I sat in my room wondering if I was crazy for thinking about you.
Ses03F_script01_3_M023	hap	We're going to live now. I'm going to make you so happy.
Ses03F_script01_3_M024	hap	I kissed you.
Ses03F_script01_3_F023	hap	Like Larry's brother. Do it like you, Chris.
Ses03F_script01_3_M025	sad	Let's drive somewhere. I want to be alone with you.
Ses03F_script01_3_F025	sad	No. What is it? Is it your mother?
Ses03F_script01_3_M026	neu	No, no, no, no. Nothing like that.
Ses03F_script01_3_F026	sad	Well then tell me what's wrong. I mean, even in your letters there's something ashamed.
Ses03F_script01_3_M027	sad	Yeah. I guess there is. I guess I was, but uh- it's going from me now.
Ses03F_script01_3_F027	sad	You should tell me.
Ses03F_script01_3_M028	sad	I don't know where to start.
Ses03F_script01_3_F028	sad	But, Chris, it wouldn't work like this.
Ses03F_script01_3_M029	sad	You know when I went overseas. I said I was in command of a company.
Ses03F_script01_3_F029	sad	Yeah, sure.
Ses03F_script01_3_M030	sad	Well, I lost them.
Ses03F_script01_3_F030	sad	How many?
Ses03F_script01_3_M031	sad	Just about all.
Ses03F_script01_3_F031	sad	Geez.
Ses03F_script01_3_M032	sad	It takes a little while to toss that off. Because they weren't just men.
Ses03F_script01_3_M033	sad	For instance, one time, it had to have been raining several days. There was this one kid, he came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks. Put them in my pocket.
Ses03F_script01_3_M034	sad	I mean, that's-that's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had. They didn't just die. They killed themselves for each other. And I mean that exactly. A little more selfish and they'd still be here today.
Ses03F_script01_3_M035	sad	And I, and I thought something watching them go down.
Ses03F_script01_3_M036	sad	Everything was being destroyed, see, but there was one new thing that was being created. A kind of responsibility, man for man. You understand me?
Ses03F_script01_3_M037	sad	And to show that-to bring that onto the earth like some sort of monument standing right behind us where everyone could feel it and it would make a difference to him.
Ses03F_script01_3_M038	sad	And I came back here and it was incredible. There was no meaning in that here. The whole thing to them was a bus accident.
Ses03F_script01_3_M039	sad	And I went to work with dad and that rat race again. And I felt what you said-ashamed somehow. Because nobody was changed at all. It seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys.
Ses03F_script01_3_M040	sad	And I felt wrong to be alive. To drive the car, to see the new checkbook, to see the new refrigerator. I mean, you can take those things out of the war. But you got to know that when you drive that car that that came out of the love a man can have for another man. And you got to be a little bit better because of that.
Ses03F_script01_3_M041	sad	Otherwise, what you have here is loot; and there's blood on it.
Ses03F_script01_3_M042	sad	And I didn't want to take any of it.
Ses03F_script01_3_M043	sad	And I guess that included you.
Ses03F_script01_3_F032	sad	And you still feel that way?
Ses03F_script01_3_F033	sad	Because you can't feel that way, never again, Chris. You hear me? Never. I mean, the money and me too.
Ses03F_script01_3_M045	hap	Annie,
Ses03F_script01_3_M046	hap	Annie, I'm going to make a fortune for you.
Ses03F_script01_3_F035	hap	What am I going to do with a fortune?
Ses03F_script02_1_M000	exc	Hey, what time is it? They're supposed to run around midnight, right? God, this is great, isn't it?
Ses03F_script02_1_M001	exc	Look at the night we got; couldn't be better.
Ses03F_script02_1_M002	exc	You know actually, I wanted to go a little further up the coast to get away from all the, the people and the lights, and uh- but I thought we'd miss it. Hey, how you doing?
Ses03F_script02_1_F000	sad	Fine.
Ses03F_script02_1_M003	exc	Oh, is that-is that-now, is that just foam, uhh, I can't even tell.
Ses03F_script02_1_M004	exc	Oh, though if I can't tell it probably isn't them, right? It probably would be unmistakable, wouldn't you think? Hey, how you doing?
Ses03F_script02_1_M005	exc	Oh, do you know what I forgot? I forgot my flashlight. How could I be so stupid. Oh, I-I should have brought my flashlight.
Ses03F_script02_1_M006	exc	Uh- you know, the flashlight. The silver one. There's only one, isn't there?
Ses03F_script02_1_F003	ang	I don't understand why you're always saying oh, it's mine, it's mine. It's not like it's just your flashlight. I mean, how do you think that makes me feel?
Ses03F_script02_1_M009	exc	We should have brought our flashlight. I can't believe we forgot to bring it.
Ses03F_script02_1_M010	exc	I hope the moon stays out.
Ses03F_script02_1_M011	exc	Hey, do they always run during a full moon? I can't remember if it was full last year. Do you remember?
Ses03F_script02_1_M013	exc	We should have brought the blanket. Oh, why didn't we bring the blanket? Our blanket.
Ses03F_script02_1_M014	exc	You know what would be good right now? A six-pack. Ah, I can't believe I forgot a six-pack. A six-pack would be just the ticket right about now.
Ses03F_script02_1_M015	exc	I'm so stupid. I'm like a little kid. I-it's amazing I get out of the house with my fly zipped. Oh- [LAUGHTER].
Ses03F_script02_1_M016	exc	I wonder if they can hear us talk. Or hear the vibrations in the sand when we move.
Ses03F_script02_1_M017	neu	Do you want my jacket?
Ses03F_script02_1_M019	neu	Right.
Ses03F_script02_1_M020	neu	Yeah, that's my point too.
Ses03F_script02_1_M021	exc	No. No, no, no, that's not my point. My point is there's no point in coming down here if we just turn around and leave.
Ses03F_script02_1_M022	neu	I mean, don't you want to see it?
Ses03F_script02_1_F010	sad	Not particularly.
Ses03F_script02_1_M023	neu	Why not?
Ses03F_script02_1_F011	sad	I don't know. I just don't.
Ses03F_script02_1_F012	ang	Pass up what? A bunch of fish. They swim up to the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die.
Ses03F_script02_1_F013	fru	I don't know why you're getting so excited. I mean, it's not like the landing of the moon or something. It's just fish. Fish that nobody eats.
Ses03F_script02_1_F014	fru	Oh, God, Augie.
Ses03F_script02_1_F017	fru	Yes, and if you also remember, I got sand in my panties. We got into an argument about nothing. You got a sore throat and we never saw the grunions.
Ses03F_script02_1_F018	fru	No, for God's sakes, we've never seen the grunions. We're not going to see them.
Ses03F_script02_1_M034	fru	We just weren't in a good spot, all right? This is a much better spot. I have a good instinct for these things. Look, is that-
Ses03F_script02_1_M036	exc	I wouldn't miss this for anything. I mean, think about this. Okay, I know you're not interested, but just think about this for a minute.
Ses03F_script02_1_M038	exc	And they all, all as one, turned as one and formed this line as big as the California coast and started swimming this way. Swimming as if that's the only thing that matters.
Ses03F_script02_1_M039	exc	You know, they didn't ask it a question. They didn't, they didn't take a vote. They didn't have an invitation or a map; they just started swimming as one.
Ses03F_script02_1_M040	exc	its single-mindedness with one mind. Urgency that's pure urge. You know, they don't give it a name.
Ses03F_script02_1_M041	exc	They don't ask it a question. They just, they just, they don't know what drives them. They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them to here
Ses03F_script02_1_M042	exc	where we stand for a massive celebration of sex and death. Oh, God, I'm giving myself goosebumps. Look, I'm all-all my hairs on my arms is sticking up.
Ses03F_script02_1_M044	neu	About what I just said.
Ses03F_script02_2_F000	neu	About what?
Ses03F_script02_2_M001	neu	About what I was just saying.
Ses03F_script02_2_M002	fru	It certainly is not. It is slightly exaggerated scientific fact.
Ses03F_script02_2_M003	fru	Well, I'm not the only one. Look at all these people.
Ses03F_script02_2_M004	fru	Are we talking about the same thing?
Ses03F_script02_2_M005	neu	Carla, can I ask you something? Don't take this wrong, but are you having your period?
Ses03F_script02_2_F005	ang	Augie, Goddamn it, don't ask me that. You always ask me that. Why do you ask me that? I hate it. It's insulting.
Ses03F_script02_2_M006	fru	Okay, then what's bugging you?
Ses03F_script02_2_F006	fru	Look, it's-we just-we're looking at this evening in a different way, both of us. We both have different ideas of it.
Ses03F_script02_2_M007	fru	There's nothing to it, alright? We come down here, the grunion arrive, they do their little fish business, we go ooh, ah, look at the fish, and then they go home and we go home.
Ses03F_script02_2_M008	neu	We're not seeing the grunions?
Ses03F_script02_2_F008	fru	Look, Augie, we've never seen them. They're never going to come.
Ses03F_script02_2_M009	fru	We missed them twice. That's not ever.
Ses03F_script02_2_M010	fru	We'll see them this time.
Ses03F_script02_2_F012	ang	Like I feel like my whole life I've been just standing on this beach with my hands clasped waiting for these fish to show up and these fish never show up.
Ses03F_script02_2_M011	fru	God, I thought you wanted to see it.
Ses03F_script02_2_F013	fru	I do.
Ses03F_script02_2_F014	fru	Look, I did. I always do. But it's like every time I try nothing ever happens.
Ses03F_script02_2_M012	fru	It's just fish. Nothing to get traumatized over.
Ses03F_script02_2_F015	fru	For God's sake, Augie, this is not about fish.
Ses03F_script02_2_M013	fru	I've been turning this thing over in my head trying to figure out when the point was when we took a turn for the worse, and I can't seem to pinpoint it.
Ses03F_script02_2_M014	fru	You were fine during the phone call from Marge. Dinner was okay. Doing the dishes was no problem. Let's see. I took a shower. You were watching the news. You said Augie, I think the grunion are running. I said great, let's go. I feel lucky tonight.
Ses03F_script02_2_M015	fru	And so I'm getting the animals, putting the animals out in the yard. I'm putting on my jacket, getting the car out of the garage-
Ses03F_script02_2_F016	sad	Do you remember the last time we came here?
Ses03F_script02_2_F017	sad	We thought I was pregnant.
Ses03F_script02_2_F018	sad	You brought a bottle of champagne.
Ses03F_script02_2_F019	hap	We took off our shoes and we danced barefoot in the sand. Under the moon.
Ses03F_script02_2_F020	hap	And you whispered so intimately in my ear so I could feel your words.
Ses03F_script02_2_F021	hap	Oh, that moment-that was it.
Ses03F_script02_2_F022	sad	I told myself finally, this is how happy I'm supposed to be.
Ses03F_script02_2_M016	neu	Wait a minute. I got it.
Ses03F_script02_2_F023	hap	Dancing barefoot in the sand. Drinking out of a bottle of champagne.
Ses03F_script02_2_F024	sad	I don't want to remember something.
Ses03F_script02_2_F025	sad	Hope for some things.
Ses03F_script02_2_F026	sad	No.
Ses03F_script02_2_F027	sad	No.
Ses03F_script02_2_F028	sad	No, no.
Ses03F_script02_2_M022	fru	What? What? Do you want me to breathe in your ear?
Ses03F_script02_2_F029	fru	No.
Ses03F_script02_2_M023	fru	Do you want to get married again? What? What? Do you want to get a divorce?
Ses03F_script02_2_F030	fru	No.
Ses03F_script02_2_F031	ang	No.
Ses03F_script02_2_M024	fru	A vacation?
Ses03F_script02_2_F032	fru	No.
Ses03F_script02_2_M025	fru	A new carpet? A poodle?
Ses03F_script02_2_M026	ang	A-a back rub, some ice cream, a suicide pact. What the hell do you want, Carla?
Ses03F_script02_2_F033	fru	I want things to turn out the way that they're supposed to be.
Ses03F_script02_2_M027	fru	Jesus, welcome to the human race.
Ses03F_script02_2_M029	fru	No, I was just like you. I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and everything great. And the wind in our hair and the sand in our toes, and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves, and we'll have three big fat rosy kids. And oh God.
Ses03F_script02_2_M030	fru	You know what you get? The jokes on us, baby. Because do you know what you get? Huh? Carla? Do you know what you get? You get this.
Ses03F_script02_2_F034	fru	This what? What is this? This is nothing.
Ses03F_script02_2_M031	fru	Yes, it is.
Ses03F_script02_2_F035	ang	No, it's not. It's standing on the beach waiting and fighting.
Ses03F_script02_2_M032	fru	Right.
Ses03F_script02_2_F036	sad	Things have never turned out anything the way that I thought they would be.
Ses03F_script02_2_M033	fru	No, I know. Me neither.
Ses03F_script02_2_F038	sad	it's not something else. Do you know what I'm trying to say?
Ses03F_script02_2_M034	fru	Well, I'm doing the best I can.
Ses03F_script02_2_F039	sad	I know you are, Augie, and I know you wanted this evening to be nice, but I can't help thinking of being somewhere else.
Ses03F_script02_2_M035	fru	Yeah, maybe if you were with someone else too.
Ses03F_script02_2_F040	sad	I didn't say that.
Ses03F_script02_2_F041	fru	Augie, anything I do I'd rather be doing with you.
Ses03F_script02_2_F042	fru	God, don't you know that? I mean, you're the one that probably wants to be with somebody else. Somebody that didn't take herself so seriously, could enjoy herself more.
Ses03F_script02_2_M038	hap	Actually now that you mention it, no, I don't.
Ses03F_script02_2_F043	hap	Well, I guess we're just in the wrong spart-spot with the right person.
Ses03F_script02_2_M039	hap	Seemed like a pretty good spot to me. I mean, look at the view of the moon we've got from here.
Ses03F_script02_2_F044	hap	I noticed that. It's beautiful.
Ses03F_script02_2_F045	hap	You can see right over the water.
Ses03F_script02_2_M040	hap	Look what we got here.
Ses03F_script02_2_M041	hap	It's not champagne.
Ses03F_script02_2_F048	hap	At least we won't need glasses.
Ses03F_script02_2_M042	neu	Are you still cold? Do you want to go home?
Ses03F_script02_2_F050	hap	Maybe this is the right place after all.
Ses03F_script02_2_F051	sad	I'm sorry, Augie.
Ses03F_script02_2_M043	neu	Shh.
Ses03F_script02_2_M044	hap	If we're very quiet the fish might come.
Ses03F_script02_2_M045	hap	Or not.
Ses03F_script03_1_F000	neu	[BREATHING]
Ses03F_script03_1_F001	neu	Do you think it's them?
Ses03F_script03_1_M004	neu	We're all right, aren't we darling? Whatever happens.
Ses03F_script03_1_M005	neu	Then I don't care.
Ses03F_script03_1_M007	exc	things that should matter dreadfully don't seem to matter at all when one's happy, do they?
Ses03F_script03_1_F009	exc	Don't laugh at me. I'm serious.
Ses03F_script03_1_M011	exc	[LAUGHTER]. You mustn't be serious, my dear one, that's what they want.
Ses03F_script03_1_M013	exc	Ooh, certainly you must. We're figures of fun, all right.
Ses03F_script03_1_F014	sad	Oh dear, well, shall we want that?
Ses03F_script03_1_F015	sad	Well, what if happens if one of us is to die? Does the one that's left still laugh?
Ses03F_script03_1_M020	exc	Let's blow strumpets, blow-blow trumpets and squeakers and party as much as we can like small quite idiotic school children. Let's savor the delight of the moment. Come, kiss me darling, before worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.
Ses03F_script03_1_F019	exc	Thank you, dear. The same applies to you. Except that if I ever so much as catch you looking at another woman I'll kill you.
Ses03F_script03_1_M022	exc	Remember that awful scene we had in Venice?
Ses03F_script03_1_F021	hap	Oh Charles. That was his name. Charles. He did wiggle so beautifully.
Ses03F_script03_1_F025	hap	yeah. And that was the first time you ever hit me.
Ses03F_script03_1_M027	exc	That was a rouser, wasn't it?
Ses03F_script03_1_F026	hap	The manager came in and found us rolling on the floor and biting and scratching like panthers. [LAUGHTER]
Ses03F_script03_1_F027	exc	I know. Oh man. Couldn't believe it.
Ses03F_script03_2_M000	ang	As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.
Ses03F_script03_2_M001	ang	I knew nothing of the sort. You took presents from him.
Ses03F_script03_2_M002	ang	I remember it well. Bristling with diamonds. In the worst possible taste.
Ses03F_script03_2_F004	neu	Just a little perhaps, but it was nothing serious.
Ses03F_script03_2_M005	ang	You let him kiss you. You said so.
Ses03F_script03_2_M007	ang	What about me?
Ses03F_script03_2_M008	ang	That's a nice point of view, I must say.
Ses03F_script03_2_F008	neu	Well, it's true.
Ses03F_script03_2_M009	neu	Are you bored with this conversation?
Ses03F_script03_2_M010	neu	So am I. Bored stiff. Want some brandy?
Ses03F_script03_2_M011	neu	I'll have a little, I think.
Ses03F_script03_2_M012	neu	No particular reason. Anyhow, they were very small ones.
Ses03F_script03_2_F013	neu	It's become a habit with you.
Ses03F_script03_2_M014	ang	You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want some yourself at the moment.
Ses03F_script03_2_F014	ang	Don't be so stupid.
Ses03F_script03_2_M015	ang	Really, Amanda.
Ses03F_script03_2_F015	ang	What?
Ses03F_script03_2_M016	ang	Nothing.
Ses03F_script03_2_M017	ang	Going somewhere, dear?
Ses03F_script03_2_F017	neu	It's a woman's job to allure the man. Watch me, won't you, a minute?
Ses03F_script03_2_F018	ang	No, it isn't.
Ses03F_script03_2_M020	ang	Yes, it is.
Ses03F_script03_2_F021	fru	Adders don't snap, they sting.
Ses03F_script03_2_F022	fru	They sting.
Ses03F_script03_2_M024	ang	They snap.
Ses03F_script03_2_F023	ang	I don't care. I don't care, do you understand? I don't care if they bark, if they roll over on the floor like hoops.
Ses03F_script03_2_M026	ang	did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?
Ses03F_script03_2_M027	ang	I imagine that you let him kiss you quite a bit more then, didn't you?
Ses03F_script03_2_F025	fru	Mind your business.
Ses03F_script03_2_M028	ang	You had a riotous-must have had a riotous time. No restraint at all. Very enjoyable. You never had much anyhow.
Ses03F_script03_2_F026	ang	You are quite insufferable. I suppose it's because you're drunk.
Ses03F_script03_2_M029	ang	I'm not in the least bit drunk.
Ses03F_script03_2_F027	fru	You've always had a weak head.
Ses03F_script03_2_M030	ang	Okay. As I mentioned before, I said I had three very minute liquor glasses. That's hardly enough to get a child of two drunk.
Ses03F_script03_2_F029	fru	Do shut up. Shut up.
Ses03F_script03_2_F030	fru	I don't want to talk about this anymore.
Ses03F_script03_2_M034	ang	Well, I suppose the people downstairs then.
Ses03F_script03_2_M035	neu	This is no time of the year for Tunis.
Ses03F_script03_2_F035	ang	Turn it on.
Ses03F_script03_2_M038	ang	Turn it off.
Ses03F_script03_2_F037	ang	I will not. Go away. Go away. I hate you.
Ses03F_script03_2_M039	ang	Oh, very amusing, indeed. Amanda, listen-
Ses03F_script03_2_F038	ang	Listen, indeed. No, no, no, no. I am sick and tired of listening to you, you sadistic bully.
Ses03F_script03_2_M040	ang	Very amusing indeed.
Ses03F_script03_2_F039	ang	Stop it, stop it, I hate you, I loath you, you are overbearing and conceited and utterly impossible.
Ses03F_script03_2_M041	ang	You know, you're a vile, ill-tempered, wicked little beast and I hope that I never see you again as long as I live.
Ses03F_script03_2_F040	ang	This is the end. Do you hear? The end. Now and forever.
Ses03F_script03_2_M042	ang	No, you're not going out like this. No you're not.
Ses03F_script03_2_F041	ang	Oh, yes I am.
Ses03F_script03_2_F042	ang	Yes I am. Let go of me. I hate you and I loath you. God, I can't believe I just finally realized how you are. I am never marry you. Never. Never, never, never. I would rather die in torment.
Ses03F_script03_2_M043	ang	Oh, shut up. Shut up. Shut up.
Ses03F_script03_2_M044	ang	I wouldn't marry you again if you came back crawling to me on your hands and knees because you're vile. You're a mean, evil-minded little vampire and I hope to God I never set eyes on you again.
Ses03F_script03_2_F043	ang	Beast or brute cad, swine beast beast brute.
Ses03M_impro01_M000	fru	Hey listen here missy, I've been in this line for an hour and now I'm finally here.  So you're going to take my application.
Ses03M_impro01_F000	neu	Is that a demand sir?
Ses03M_impro01_M001	fru	It's not a demand it's a request.  Will you just take it?  Come on.
Ses03M_impro01_F002	fru	Sir, you completely filled this out wrong.
Ses03M_impro01_F003	neu	No.  You filled out the back part.  You were supposed to fill out the front portion only.
Ses03M_impro01_M004	ang	What are you talking about?  It says fill out that part.
Ses03M_impro01_F004	fru	No, no, no, no, no.  You're going to have to go back over on the other side-- --second door, up the stairs...
Ses03M_impro01_M005	fru	Okay.
Ses03M_impro01_M006	fru	Oh my God. Can you just transfer it yourself?
Ses03M_impro01_F005	fru	No I can't just transfer it myself sir.  You got to do this.  Everyone else is doing the same thing.

Ses03M_impro08b_F024	neu	Alright Thanks.
Ses03M_script01_1_F000	neu	What's he going to say?  Maybe we ought to talk to him before he sees it.
Ses03M_script01_1_M000	sad	He saw it.
Ses03M_script01_1_M001	sad	He was out there when it happened.
Ses03M_script01_1_M002	sad	About four in the morning.  I heard a crack and I looked out and he was standing right there when it happened.
Ses03M_script01_1_M003	sad	I don't know. But after it cracked he ran back into the house and he cried in the kitchen.
Ses03M_script01_1_F004	sad	Did you talk to him?
Ses03M_script01_1_M004	sad	No.  I figured the best thing to do was leave him alone.
Ses03M_script01_1_F005	sad	He cried hard?
Ses03M_script01_1_M005	sad	I could hear it right through the floor.
Ses03M_script01_1_F007	fru	Starting to dream about him again.  He's walking around at night again.
Ses03M_script01_1_M006	sad	I guess he is.
Ses03M_script01_1_F008	sad	He's getting just like he did after he died, you know?  What, what, what's the meaning of this?
Ses03M_script01_1_M007	sad	I don't know.  But I know one thing mom, we made a terrible mistake with dad.
Ses03M_script01_1_M008	fru	Being dishonest with him.  That kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.
Ses03M_script01_1_M009	ang	You know that Larry's not coming back and I know that too.  Why we both go on letting him think that we both believe with him.
Ses03M_script01_1_M010	fru	No I don't want to argue with him but, it's time that he realizes that nobody believes Larry's coming back anymore.
Ses03M_script01_1_M011	ang	Why shouldn't he walk around and dream at him at night.  Walk around.  Why shouldn't he walk around?  Why shouldn't he dream of him, walk around at night waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say flat out that we don't have anymore hope?
Ses03M_script01_1_M012	ang	That we haven't had any hope for years now?
Ses03M_script01_1_F013	fru	How are you going to prove it?  Can you prove it?
Ses03M_script01_1_M014	fru	Larry's been gone for three years.  For god sakes no one comes back after three years.  It's insane.
Ses03M_script01_1_F015	fru	he still thinks he's alive still.  I mean you could talk yourself blue in the face and there's no body and there's no grave so where are you?
Ses03M_script01_1_M015	fru	Listen mom, just, sit down.  I want to talk to you.
Ses03M_script01_1_F016	ang	No.  It's his god damned newspapers is what it is.  Now every month there's a new boy comes home and Larry's going to be the next one.
Ses03M_script01_1_M016	fru	Alright. Alright. Alright just listen.
Ses03M_script01_1_M017	neu	You know why I asked Annie here, right?
Ses03M_script01_1_F017	ang	Why?
Ses03M_script01_1_M019	neu	I want to ask her to marry me.
Ses03M_script01_1_M020	fru	You know it's not just my business.
Ses03M_script01_1_F020	ang	Well what do you want me to do?  I mean, you're old enough to know your own mind.
Ses03M_script01_1_M021	neu	Okay.  So then it's alright.  I'll go ahead with it.
Ses03M_script01_1_F021	neu	Well, I mean, you got to make sure your dad's not going--
Ses03M_script01_1_M022	ang	Oh see then it's just not my business. God you infuriate me sometimes.  Isn't my business too if dad throws a fit?  Huh?  God you have such a talent for ignoring things.
Ses03M_script01_1_F022	fru	Well I'm just saying--
Ses03M_script01_1_M023	fru	She's not Larry's girl.
Ses03M_script01_1_F025	fru	From your father's point of view he is still alive and if you try and take her that's just not fair.  You can't do that.
Ses03M_script01_1_M024	fru	I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something I want I have to pull back
Ses03M_script01_1_F026	fru	And-And-And if you go on from there if you know already to go on from there, then you can.  But I'm telling you something that I don't know where to go.  You got it?  I mean, do you?
Ses03M_script01_1_M026	fru	My whole entire, bloody life time and time again.
Ses03M_script01_1_M027	ang	Well to hell with that.
Ses03M_script01_1_F028	neu	Did you ask Annie yet?
Ses03M_script01_1_M028	neu	I wanted to get this settled first.
Ses03M_script01_1_M029	neu	Then I guess that's the end of it.
Ses03M_script01_1_M030	sad	But from her letters I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out.
Ses03M_script01_1_M031	neu	And then we'll thrash it out with dad right?  Mom, don't avoid me.
Ses03M_script01_1_F030	neu	Look, you never had seen many, many women.  You know?  I mean...
Ses03M_script01_1_F031	fru	Well I just don't see why it has to be Annie.
Ses03M_script01_1_M033	fru	Because it is.
Ses03M_script01_1_M034	fru	It's just...that's just the way it is.  That's how I feel.  You know these years when I think of someone I want to marry I think of Annie.  What do you want a diagram?
Ses03M_script01_1_F033	fru	No I don't want a diagram.
Ses03M_script01_1_F034	fru	He thinks he's coming back. And you go off and marry that girl and you're just pronouncing him dead and what's going to happen to him?  I don't know.  Do you?  I mean, I don't know.
Ses03M_script01_1_M035	fru	Alright then.
Ses03M_script01_1_M036	sad	I've given it three years of thought and I thought that if I waited then dad would forget about Larry and then we could have a regular wedding and everything happy.
Ses03M_script01_1_M037	neu	But if I can't have that here I'll get out.
Ses03M_script01_1_M038	neu	I'll get out.  I'll marry her somewhere else.  Maybe New York.
Ses03M_script01_1_M039	ang	I've been a good son too long.  A good sucker and I'm through with it.
Ses03M_script01_1_F038	ang	You're just going to leave the business?  You have a business here.  You can't do that.
Ses03M_script01_1_M040	ang	The business doesn't inspire me.
Ses03M_script01_1_M041	ang	Yes.  I like it an hour out of the day.  If I have to grub for money all day long at least at evening I want it beautiful.  I want a family.  I want a wife.  I want some kids.  I want to build something I can give myself to.
Ses03M_script01_1_M042	fru	Now Annie is in the middle of all that.  Where do I find it?
Ses03M_script01_1_F040	sad	Tell me something.  You can leave this business?
Ses03M_script01_1_M043	neu	Yes.  On this I would.
Ses03M_script01_1_F042	fru	Alright but you can't talk like that you hear?
Ses03M_script01_1_F043	ang	I mean what the hell have we worked for then?  I mean, it's all for you Chris.  The whole shooting match is for you.
Ses03M_script01_1_M045	sad	I know.  Just you help me stay here.
Ses03M_script01_1_F044	fru	Alright but you don't talk like that you hear?  You don't.
Ses03M_script01_1_M046	sad	I am thinking like that.
Ses03M_script01_1_F045	sad	I don't understand you do I?
Ses03M_script01_1_M047	sad	No you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.
Ses03M_script01_1_F046	sad	Yeah.  I can see that.
Ses03M_script01_2_F000	ang	Why did he invite her here?
Ses03M_script01_2_M000	fru	Why does that bother you?
Ses03M_script01_2_F001	ang	Well she's been away for three and a half years in New York and suddenly she just shows up.
Ses03M_script01_2_M001	neu	Well maybe, maybe he just wanted to see her.
Ses03M_script01_2_M002	fru	uh-uh What do you mean?  They grew up next to each other their entire lives.  Why shouldn't he want to see her?
Ses03M_script01_2_M003	fru	Hey don't look at me like that.  I don't know anymore than you.
Ses03M_script01_2_M004	neu	Who said he even thought about that?
Ses03M_script01_2_M005	neu	Well, so what?
Ses03M_script01_2_M006	fru	Now listen kid...
Ses03M_script01_2_F006	ang	No.  She's not his girl Joe and she knows that.
Ses03M_script01_2_M008	neu	How do you know why she's waited?  Hmmm?
Ses03M_script01_2_F009	ang	I mean, her faith is stronger than a rock.
Ses03M_script01_2_F010	sad	My worst times I think about her, you know, and I
Ses03M_script01_2_F011	sad	it's like I know as long as she's waiting I'm right again.
Ses03M_script01_2_M009	fru	Look at how nice the day is.  What are we arguing for?
Ses03M_script01_2_F012	ang	No.  Nobody in my house better dare and challenge her faith.  You know and maybe strangers but not his father, not his brother.
Ses03M_script01_2_M010	fru	What do you want me to do?  What do you want?
Ses03M_script01_2_M011	fru	But Kate...
Ses03M_script01_2_F015	ang	Laugh, laugh at me but I will.  Because you know what happened when she came here?  When she came back she slept in his room, the memorial broke into pieces. Joe, look. Look at it. You got to believe with me.
Ses03M_script01_2_M012	fru	Okay. Calm yourself. Just calm yourself.
Ses03M_script01_2_F017	sad	Look, it was just last week that Detroit, some boy came back he had been away longer than Larry, you can read it for yourself. You above all people have got to believe.
Ses03M_script01_2_M014	ang	Alright, alright, calm yourself okay?  Calm yourself. Wait, wait.  What do you mean, me above all?
Ses03M_script01_2_M015	ang	Wait, what does that mean?  Me above all?
Ses03M_script01_2_M016	ang	Look at you, you're shaking.
Ses03M_script01_2_F019	sad	I can't help it.
Ses03M_script01_2_M017	ang	What do I got to hide?  Huh?  What the hell's the matter with you Kate?
Ses03M_script01_3_M001	neu	You're not sorry you came?
Ses03M_script01_3_F004	sad	No.  I'm not sorry.  But I'm not going to stay.
Ses03M_script01_3_F006	sad	Look,
Ses03M_script01_3_F007	sad	you saw the way that she acted and then well, I mean, you, you were acting kind of...
Ses03M_script01_3_M004	neu	What?
Ses03M_script01_3_F008	sad	Well, I don't know, embarrassed of her since I came.
Ses03M_script01_3_M008	hap	I mean, that's the reason why I asked you here.
Ses03M_script01_3_F011	hap	Well,
Ses03M_script01_3_M010	hap	I love you.
Ses03M_script01_3_F012	hap	I guess that's why I came.
Ses03M_script01_3_F013	hap	Look, I've been ready for a long, long time now.
Ses03M_script01_3_F014	hap	Look, I almost got married two years ago.
Ses03M_script01_3_F015	hap	You started to write me.
Ses03M_script01_3_M016	hap	You felt something that far back.
Ses03M_script01_3_F016	hap	Every day since.
Ses03M_script01_3_F017	hap	I was waiting for you Chris, I mean, till then you never wrote and then when you did what did you say?
Ses03M_script01_3_F018	hap	You'd always be so ambiguous.
Ses03M_script01_3_M018	hap	Give me a kiss Ann, just give me...
Ses03M_script01_3_M019	exc	Oh God.  Annie, I kissed Annie.  I kissed Annie.
Ses03M_script01_3_F019	hap	I'll never forgive you for that.
Ses03M_script01_3_F020	hap	I mean,  Why did you wait all these years?  There I was sitting around and wondering if I was crazy for thinking about you.
Ses03M_script01_3_M021	hap	We're going to live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.
Ses03M_script01_3_F021	hap	Not like that you're not.
Ses03M_script01_3_M023	sad	Nothing.  Hey, let's drive somewhere.  I want to be alone with you.
Ses03M_script01_3_M027	sad	You remember overseas I was in command of a company?
Ses03M_script01_3_M028	sad	Well I lost them.
Ses03M_script01_3_F029	sad	How many?
Ses03M_script01_3_M029	sad	Just about all.
Ses03M_script01_3_F030	sad	Geez.
Ses03M_script01_3_M030	sad	Takes a little while to toss that off cause they weren't just men.
Ses03M_script01_3_M031	sad	For instance, one time this...it had been raining several days and this one kid, he came up to me, he gave me his last pair of dry socks, put them in my pocket.
Ses03M_script01_3_M032	sad	That's just a little thing but that's the kind of guys I had.  They didn't just die, they killed themselves for each other and I mean that exactly.
Ses03M_script01_3_M033	sad	A little more selfish and they'd still be here today.  And I got this idea watching them go down.  See everything was being destroyed but there was one new thing that was being created.
Ses03M_script01_3_M034	sad	It was a kind of responsibility, man for man.  You understand me?
Ses03M_script01_3_M035	sad	And to show that and to bring that onto the earth again like some sort of monument standing right behind all of us and we could feel it and it would make a difference to him.
Ses03M_script01_3_M036	sad	And then I came here and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them was a kind of bus accident.
Ses03M_script01_3_M037	sad	And I went to work with dad and that rat race again and I felt what you said, ashamed.  Somehow because nobody was changed at all.
Ses03M_script01_3_M038	sad	It seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive.  I felt wrong to have that new checkbook,
Ses03M_script01_3_M039	sad	open that new bank account, drive the new car and see the new refrigerator
Ses03M_script01_3_M040	sad	cause you can take those things out of the war.  But you got to know, when you drive that car that it came out of the love that a man can have for a man and you got to be a little bit better because of that.
Ses03M_script01_3_M041	sad	Otherwise what you have is loot and there's blood on it.
Ses03M_script01_3_M042	sad	And I didn't want to take any of it and I guess that included you.
Ses03M_script01_3_F031	sad	And you still feel that way?
Ses03M_script01_3_F033	sad	that includes me too, I mean and the money, you have right to that money.  Your father put planes up in the air, good planes and he deserves it, you should be proud of that.  A man should be paid for that.
Ses03M_script01_3_M045	hap	Annie I'm going to make a fortune for you.
Ses03M_script01_3_F034	hap	What am I going to do with a fortune?
Ses03M_script01_3_M046	hap	Buy some hats?
Ses03M_script02_1_M000	exc	Hey, what time is it?  This pokes around midnight right?  God this is great isn't it?
Ses03M_script02_1_M001	exc	Look at the night we got.  I wouldn't trade this for anything.
Ses03M_script02_1_M002	exc	You know actually I wanted to go a little further up the coast and get away from all the lights and people but I was afraid you'd miss it.  How are you doing?
Ses03M_script02_1_M003	exc	Is that, is that, nah, is that just Paul?  I can't even tell.
Ses03M_script02_1_M004	exc	But if I can't tell, it probably isn't them isn't it?  Probably would be unmistakable wouldn't you think?  How are you doing?
Ses03M_script02_1_M005	exc	Oh, you know what I forgot?  I forgot my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I should've brought my flashlight.
Ses03M_script02_1_F005	neu	Yes.
Ses03M_script02_1_M014	exc	God.  Oh, you know what would be good right about now?  A six-pack.  A six-pack would be just the ticket.
Ses03M_script02_1_M015	exc	I'm so stupid, I should've brought a six-pack.  God, I'm like a little kid.  It's amazing I get out of the house with my fly zipped up. Oh- [LAUGHTER]
Ses03M_script02_1_M016	exc	I wonder if they can hear us talk?  Or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around?
Ses03M_script02_1_M017	neu	Do you want my jacket?
Ses03M_script02_1_F007	fru	It's past eleven, let's go.
Ses03M_script02_1_F008	fru	There is no point in coming down here.
Ses03M_script02_1_F009	fru	That's my point.
Ses03M_script02_1_M020	fru	That's my point too...No.  No.  That's not my point.  My point is what's the point if we come down here if we just turn around and leave?
Ses03M_script02_1_M023	exc	Honey, this is a natural phenomenon.  It only happens once a year.  I mean think about the people in Kansas, they would have to get hotel reservations and plane tickets to come and see this.  We're only forty minutes away.  This is too good to pass up.
Ses03M_script02_1_F013	fru	Pass up what?  These fish swim up to shore, on the beach and then they flop around a little, they swim away and then they die.
Ses03M_script02_1_M024	exc	Well this is like the highlight, the one night of their lives and that flopping around, that's laying eggs or spawning or mating or whatever you call it.
Ses03M_script02_1_M025	exc	But this is the big night for these guys.  Their last, life's last orgy.
Ses03M_script02_1_M026	exc	Yeah they do.
Ses03M_script02_1_F015	fru	Augie.
Ses03M_script02_1_M027	exc	Okay.  But it's fish that do something that no other fish do.  Like the swallows in Capistrano or the Lemmings that throw themselves off the cliffs, there's magic here and some mystery and a little bit of unexplainable.
Ses03M_script02_1_F016	neu	I'm just not.
Ses03M_script02_1_F018	fru	You also could remember that I got sand in my panties, we got in an argument over nothing, you got a sore throat and we didn't even get to see the Grunions.
Ses03M_script02_1_F019	fru	You didn't see them the first time either.
Ses03M_script02_1_M033	fru	We just weren't in the good spot.  This is a much better spot.  You know, I have a good instincts for these things.
Ses03M_script02_1_M034	exc	Look, is that...no is that just seaweed?
Ses03M_script02_1_M035	exc	You know, this is great isn't it?  You know, I wouldn't trade this for anything.
Ses03M_script02_1_M036	exc	I mean, think about this, I know you're not interested but just think about this for a minute.
Ses03M_script02_1_M037	exc	Somewhere out there, there's this huge silver mass of fish heading this way, they don't why, we don't know why, they just some little instinctual fire cracker went off in their bodies...
Ses03M_script02_1_M038	exc	...like and they all just turned at once and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming this way.  They didn't, you know, they didn't make a decision, they didn't, you know, have boats or anything.  No one sent them an invitation or a map, they just started swimming as if that's the only thing that matters.
Ses03M_script02_1_M039	exc	It's single mindedness with no mind.  It's urgency that's pure urge and they don't, they don't ask it a question, they don't give it a name, they just swim.
Ses03M_script02_1_M040	exc	They just start swimming to this place right here where we stand for massive celebration of sex and death.
Ses03M_script02_1_M041	exc	Oh, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  Look, all my hairs are standing up.
Ses03M_script02_1_M042	exc	[BREATHING] So what do you think?
Ses03M_script02_1_M043	exc	About what I just said?
Ses03M_script02_1_M044	fru	It certainly is not.  It's
Ses03M_script02_2_M000	exc	So what do you think?
Ses03M_script02_2_F000	ang	About what?
Ses03M_script02_2_M001	fru	About what I just said?
Ses03M_script02_2_F001	ang	It's ridiculous.
Ses03M_script02_2_M002	fru	It certainly is not.  It's a slightly exaggerated scientific fact.
Ses03M_script02_2_F002	ang	It's PR.  I mean, somebody sold you a good bill about this wonderful event that going to happen on the beach.
Ses03M_script02_2_M003	fru	I'm not the only one.  Look at all these people.
Ses03M_script02_2_F003	ang	Yeah.  Everyone else was sold the same thing.  I mean, look, it keeps us excited, it keeps us coming back for more and you know, keeps us thinking life's going to start any minute now.
Ses03M_script02_2_M004	fru	Are we talking about the same thing?
Ses03M_script02_2_F004	ang	Look, I'm sorry but it's still just fish to me.
Ses03M_script02_2_M005	fru	I thought you wanted to see it.
Ses03M_script02_2_M006	fru	There's nothing to it.  The Grunions arrive, they do their little fish business, you know?  We go oh, ahh, look at the fish and they go home and we go home.
Ses03M_script02_2_F007	fru	For heavens sake, grow up.  We're not going to see the Grunions.
Ses03M_script02_2_M007	fru	Why not?
Ses03M_script02_2_F008	fru	We never do, do we?  Have we ever?
Ses03M_script02_2_M008	fru	Oh my gosh.  We missed them twice, that's hardly ever.
Ses03M_script02_2_F009	ang	Okay.  Twice is as many times as we've tried and that's ever.
Ses03M_script02_2_M009	fru	Carla, can I ask you something?
Ses03M_script02_2_M010	fru	Don't take this wrong but, are you having your period?
Ses03M_script02_2_F011	ang	Augie, god dammit, don't ask me that.  You always ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  It's insulting.
Ses03M_script02_2_M011	fru	What's bugging you then?
Ses03M_script02_2_F012	fru	Look, it's pointless.  It's...we're not going to see the Grunions I mean, it's like waiting around to see Santa Claus, you know, it's...
Ses03M_script02_2_F013	ang	Listen, I've waiting my entire life on this beach just standing there waiting for this fish to show up and these fish never show up.
Ses03M_script02_2_M012	fru	I thought you wanted to see it.
Ses03M_script02_2_F014	fru	God, you don't understand anything.
Ses03M_script02_2_M013	fru	No, of course not.
Ses03M_script02_2_F015	fru	I do.  I always do.  I keep thinking, this time will be the time and it never is.
Ses03M_script02_2_M014	neu	Well, we're going to see it.
Ses03M_script02_2_F016	ang	No we won't.  I mean, God, this isn't about the fish Augie.
Ses03M_script02_2_M015	fru	What...I've been trying to, I've been trying to figure out the point where we went wrong and I can't seem to pinpoint that moment.
Ses03M_script02_2_M017	neu	Let's see I took a shower, you were watching the news, you said hey, hey the Grunions are running tonight and I said great let's go, I feel lucky tonight.
Ses03M_script02_2_M018	fru	And then I'm putting the animals out in the yard, I'm pulling the car out of the garage, putting my jacket on.
Ses03M_script02_2_F017	fru	Look, do you remember the first time we came here?
Ses03M_script02_2_F018	sad	We thought I was pregnant.
Ses03M_script02_2_M019	neu	Wait a minute.  I've got it.
Ses03M_script02_2_M020	neu	It was in the car right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker...
Ses03M_script02_2_M021	neu	And you said let's get some champagne and I said time's a wasting or something like that.
Ses03M_script02_2_M022	neu	You want this to be like the other time right?  That's it right?
Ses03M_script02_2_F023	sad	I'd rather not remember something...
Ses03M_script02_2_F024	sad	Rather not hope for something.
Ses03M_script02_2_F025	sad	No.
Ses03M_script02_2_M024	fru	Do you want me to get some champagne?
Ses03M_script02_2_F026	fru	No.
Ses03M_script02_2_M025	fru	Take off our shoes?
Ses03M_script02_2_F027	fru	No.
Ses03M_script02_2_M026	fru	What?  Do you want me to breathe in your ear?
Ses03M_script02_2_F028	fru	No.
Ses03M_script02_2_F029	fru	No...No...No...
Ses03M_script02_2_F030	fru	No...
Ses03M_script02_2_F031	ang	I want things to turn out the way that they're supposed to be.
Ses03M_script02_2_M028	ang	Welcome to the human race.
Ses03M_script02_2_M029	ang	Do you think that this is what I had in mind?  That four years down the line that we'd get married and come to the beach and argue with each other over fish?  No.
Ses03M_script02_2_M030	ang	I was just like you.  I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and everything great and the sand in our toes and the wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'd have three big fat rosy kids...
Ses03M_script02_2_M031	ang	...and you know?  Baby the jokes on us.  Because you know what you get?  Do you know what you get Carla?  You get this.
Ses03M_script02_2_F032	fru	This what...what's this?  This isn't anything. Alright.  Sure.  Standing on the beach, fighting and waiting.
Ses03M_script02_2_M032	ang	Yes it is.
Ses03M_script02_2_M033	ang	Right.
Ses03M_script02_2_F033	ang	Cause everything isn't anything like I thought it would be.
Ses03M_script02_2_F034	sad	This is just this.  You know?  I mean it's a lot and everything but it isn't somewhere else.  Do you know what I'm trying to say?
Ses03M_script02_2_M035	fru	I'm trying to do the best I can.
Ses03M_script02_2_F035	sad	I know you are Augie.  I know you wanted this evening to be nice.
Ses03M_script02_2_F036	sad	I can't help thinking about being somewhere else.
Ses03M_script02_2_M036	sad	Maybe if you were with someone else too.
Ses03M_script02_2_F037	sad	I didn't say that.
Ses03M_script02_2_M037	sad	I know.  But I know I don't make you happy.
Ses03M_script02_2_F038	sad	Augie, whatever I'm doing I'd rather be doing with you.
Ses03M_script02_2_F040	sad	If anybody wants to be with anybody else it's probably you.  Probably somebody who enjoys herself a little more and is not so hard.
Ses03M_script02_2_F041	sad	Well, I guess this is the wrong spot for the right people.
Ses03M_script02_2_M041	hap	I mean look at the view of the moon we got from here.
Ses03M_script02_2_F042	hap	Yeah.  I noticed that.  It's real pretty on the water.
Ses03M_script02_2_M042	hap	Hey, look what we got here.
Ses03M_script02_2_F044	hap	Oh you brought refreshments.
Ses03M_script02_2_F046	hap	No I'm beginning to think you might be right.
Ses03M_script02_2_F047	hap	I think this may be the place for us after all.
Ses03M_script02_2_F048	hap	I am sorry Augie.
Ses03M_script02_2_M045	hap	Shh.  If we're very quiet the fish might come.
Ses03M_script02_2_F049	hap	Or not.
Ses03M_script02_2_M046	hap	Or not.
Ses03M_script03_1_F003	exc	Now and always sweet.
Ses03M_script03_1_M004	exc	I don't care then.
Ses03M_script03_1_F004	exc	I mean, it was, it's bound to come out sooner or later.
Ses03M_script03_1_F005	exc	That sent shivers up my spine.
Ses03M_script03_1_M006	exc	No, wrong number.
Ses03M_script03_1_F006	exc	Behave exquisitely.
Ses03M_script03_1_F018	sad	That's serious enough.
Ses03M_script03_1_M035	neu	I didn't hit you very hard.
Ses03M_script03_2_M000	neu	Yes.  The real cause of that rile was Peter Burden.
Ses03M_script03_2_F000	neu	Oh, come on, you knew there was nothing in that.
Ses03M_script03_2_F001	ang	Presents?  A trivial little broach.
Ses03M_script03_2_M003	ang	You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.
Ses03M_script03_2_F003	neu	No I didn't.  You made up the whole thing in your jealous imagination.
Ses03M_script03_2_M004	ang	You must admit he was in love with you.
Ses03M_script03_2_F004	neu	Just a little perhaps but nothing serious.
Ses03M_script03_2_M005	ang	You let him kiss you. You said so.  What of it?
Ses03M_script03_2_F006	neu	Well it didn't harm him, in fact, it pleasured him a lot and it didn't hurt me.
Ses03M_script03_2_M006	ang	And what about me?
Ses03M_script03_2_M007	ang	Oh, that's a nice point of view I must say.
Ses03M_script03_2_M008	ang	Yeah, so am I.  Bored stiff.
Ses03M_script03_2_M009	neu	You want some brandy?
Ses03M_script03_2_M010	neu	I'll have a little I think.
Ses03M_script03_2_F010	ang	I don't know why you want it.  You've already had two glasses.
Ses03M_script03_2_M011	ang	No particular reason.  Anyhow they were very small ones.
Ses03M_script03_2_F011	ang	I don't see what you have to go on and on with this kind of thing.
Ses03M_script03_2_M012	ang	Oh my...just because I just...okay...
Ses03M_script03_2_F012	neu	It's become a habit with you.
Ses03M_script03_2_M014	ang	You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want any yourself at the moment.
Ses03M_script03_2_M015	fru	Really Amanda.
Ses03M_script03_2_F014	ang	What?
Ses03M_script03_2_M016	fru	Nothing.
Ses03M_script03_2_M017	fru	Going out somewhere dear?
Ses03M_script03_2_F016	neu	No, just making myself beautiful for you.
Ses03M_script03_2_F017	neu	That's the woman's job to lure the man.  Watch me a moment won't you?
Ses03M_script03_2_M019	neu	Actually that's perfectly true.
Ses03M_script03_2_M020	neu	Yes it is.
Ses03M_script03_2_M021	neu	I think that
Ses03M_script03_2_F024	ang	Adders don't snap, they sting.
Ses03M_script03_2_F025	ang	They sting.
Ses03M_script03_2_M025	fru	They snap.
Ses03M_script03_2_F028	ang	Mind your business.
Ses03M_script03_2_F029	ang	You're quite insufferable.  I expect it's because you're drunk.
Ses03M_script03_2_M029	ang	I'm not in the least bit drunk.
Ses03M_script03_2_F030	ang	You've always had a weak head.
Ses03M_script03_2_M030	ang	Okay, like I mentioned before I had three very small, minute liquor glasses of brandy.  That's not even enough to get a child of two drunk.
Ses03M_script03_2_F031	ang	On the contrary, a child of two can get violently drunk off just one glass of brandy.
Ses03M_script03_2_M031	ang	Oh, what an interesting topic.  What about a child of four and a child of six?  A child of nine?
Ses03M_script03_2_F032	ang	Shut up.
Ses03M_script03_2_M032	ang	We might be able to bring up a splendid little debate about this intemperate tots.
Ses03M_script03_2_F033	ang	Not very funny dear.  In fact, maybe you better have some more brandy.
Ses03M_script03_2_M033	ang	Oh, thanks.  I think I will.
Ses03M_script03_2_M034	ang	You better turn that off.
Ses03M_script03_2_F036	neu	They are away in Tunis.
Ses03M_script03_2_F037	fru	Turn it on again, please.
Ses03M_script03_2_M038	ang	No I'll do no such thing.
Ses03M_script03_2_F038	ang	Very well.  If you insist on being a boorish and idiotic.
Ses03M_script03_2_M039	ang	Come on, turn it off.  It's driving me mad.
Ses03M_script03_2_F039	ang	You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.
Ses03M_script03_2_M040	ang	Turn it--Turn it off.
Ses03M_script03_2_F040	ang	Go away.  Go away.  I hate you.
Ses03M_script03_2_M041	ang	Very amusing indeed.
Ses03M_script03_2_F041	ang	I hate you.  Listen I'm sick and tired of listening to you, you sadistic bully.
Ses03M_script03_2_M042	ang	You know what?  You're a vile, little, evil-minded, little, wicked beast and I never want to see you again.
Ses03M_script03_2_F042	ang	This is the end.  Understand?  This is the end, here and now, forever and always.
Ses03M_script03_2_M043	ang	You're not going nowhere. No you're not.
Ses03M_script03_2_F043	ang	Oh, yes I am. Yes I am and you can't stop me.
Ses03M_script03_2_M044	ang	Just shut up.
Ses03M_script03_2_M045	ang	shut up. shut up.  I would-I would never marry you again if you came crawling back to me on your hands and knees because you're an evil-minded little vampire and I hope to God I never see you again.
Ses03M_script03_2_F044	ang	Listen, you're a cruel fiend and I hate, loathe you.  Thank God finally, finally thank God I've realized just how horrible you are--and marry you?  Marry you?  Never. I will never marry you.  I will die die in torment-
Ses03M_script03_2_F045	ang	Beast. Brute. Cad. Swine. Beast. Beast. Brute. Devil. Sorry.
Ses03M_script03_2_M046	ang	Oh.
Ses04F_impro01_M000	fru	Uh, lets- What do you need exactly?
Ses04F_impro01_F001	fru	Well I filled out all the forms and I've given them to everyone and they keep sending me to someone else.
Ses04F_impro01_M001	fru	You need a new license, is that what you're telling me?
Ses04F_impro01_F002	fru	Yes.  I'm just trying to get a new license.
Ses04F_impro01_M002	fru	Let me see the form. Just let me see the form. Yeah.  You filled this out wrong.  I can't - I can't - I can't do anything with this.
Ses04F_impro01_F003	fru	Okay.  I did-
Ses04F_impro01_M003	fru	Ma'am I cannot help you.  You need to fill out a new form and you need to get in the back of the line.
Ses04F_impro01_F004	ang	I did exactly what they told me to do.
Ses04F_impro01_F005	fru	I have done everything everyone in this entire place has told me to do.  I've been here for over an hour.  They make me wait in line.  Every single time I start over again.
Ses04F_impro01_M004	fru	Ma'am I can't help you.  Do you understand?
Ses04F_impro01_F006	fru	I have a life.  I have things to do.  I have places to go.  Can you not just put this through please?
Ses04F_impro01_M005	ang	I've got a life too ma'am
Ses04F_impro01_M006	fru	and I got to - i got to work here all day long.  Okay.  I've got to deal with you people all day.
Ses04F_impro01_M007	fru	So what I need you to do is I need you to fill out this form correctly and go to the back of the line.
Ses04F_impro01_F007	fru	Okay, that's nice. That's nice but I have done everything you people have told me to do. I don't understand why you can't just help me get this done.  It's simple, right?  License.  I need it. Can we just do this please?
Ses04F_impro01_M008	ang	There's nothing I can do for you.  Do you understand that?  Nothing.
Ses04F_impro01_M009	fru	What I need you to do is go to the back of the line,
Ses04F_impro01_F008	ang	I've been to the back of the line five times.
Ses04F_impro01_M010	fru	fill out this form and wait
Ses04F_impro01_M011	ang	You're going to have to go back again.
Ses04F_impro01_F009	ang	Okay.  What is it that I did wrong on the form that I have to start all over again?
Ses04F_impro01_M013	fru	and you filled out-
Ses04F_impro01_F010	ang	Okay.  Well, I can do that right here right now without going to the back of the line again.  See look initialed.  All done. Ready to go.
Ses04F_impro01_M014	ang	Ma'am I have other people waiting in line right now.  I have other people waiting in line right now.
Ses04F_impro01_F011	fru	I have been waiting for over an hour.
Ses04F_impro01_M015	fru	This whole area of the form was not supposed to be filled out and you put the address in the wrong place
Ses04F_impro01_M016	fru	Uhh, and you spelled your own name wrong.  So I need you to take that
Ses04F_impro01_F012	ang	I'm not starting over again.  No I have done this five times.  I am not starting over again.
Ses04F_impro01_M017	fru	and, uh, throw it away. I need you to fill out a new form.
Ses04F_impro01_M018	fru	Ma'am you're going to have- you- look. You really- you really
Ses04F_impro01_F013	fru	Look can you not just help me?
Ses04F_impro01_F014	ang	I mean look she's -she's perfectly nice.  She doesn't mind waiting for a couple of minutes because I've been here all day. I have a job to get back to.  I have kids to pick up from school.  I can't just stay here.
Ses04F_impro01_M021	ang	like I said before right now.
Ses04F_impro01_F016	ang	This is your job is to help people like me who need to get a new license.
Ses04F_impro01_M022	fru	Ma'am you are testing my patience.  Do you understand me?
Ses04F_impro01_M023	ang	You're testing my goddamn patience.
Ses04F_impro01_F019	ang	I'm testing your patience?
Ses04F_impro01_M024	ang	I work in this fucking building all day. And I'm sick of it, okay?
Ses04F_impro01_F021	ang	I don't need to be.  I need to go and do other things with my time.  Okay.
Ses04F_impro01_F022	ang	Please just put the form in, take the picture, let me get my license and get the hell out of here.  Please.
Ses04F_impro02_M000	sad	So you're leaving tomorrow.
Ses04F_impro02_F000	sad	Yeah.  They just called.
Ses04F_impro02_M001	sad	This is really-this is unfair.
Ses04F_impro02_F001	sad	I know.
Ses04F_impro02_M002	fru	I don't see [BREATHING]
Ses04F_impro02_F002	sad	I don't know what to say.  I don't want to go but I don't have a lot of choice.
Ses04F_impro02_M003	fru	I mean we both knew that this was going to happen.  It's just that I feel that, you know, I don't want Susie growing up without a mother.
Ses04F_impro02_M004	sad	And, uh, I'm afraid that if you, you know, when you leave, you won't come back.
Ses04F_impro02_F003	sad	I'm going to come back.  I need you to believe that.
Ses04F_impro02_M005	fru	You don't know that.
Ses04F_impro02_M006	fru	I'll believe it, but- I'll believe it but it- I don't know that that's going to happen.
Ses04F_impro02_F005	sad	Well you have to have faith because I don't have a choice and I have to go.
Ses04F_impro02_F006	sad	Do you think I want to leave you?
Ses04F_impro02_M008	fru	You have a choice.
Ses04F_impro02_F007	sad	I have to do this.  I don't want to leave.  Do you think I want to miss seeing her grow up?
Ses04F_impro02_M009	fru	I know.  It's just you don't have to do this for a living you know.
Ses04F_impro02_M010	fru	You're a smart person.  There are other things you can do.
Ses04F_impro02_F008	fru	Look we both knew what this meant when I signed on
Ses04F_impro02_F009	sad	And now- and now it's really shitty timing but now I have to go.
Ses04F_impro02_F010	fru	I mean I'm the one who has to leave here.  I'm the one who has to leave the two of you.  At least you get to be together.
Ses04F_impro02_F011	sad	What's that supposed to mean?
Ses04F_impro02_M012	sad	I mean we can't-we're not a complete family without you here.
Ses04F_impro02_F012	ang	Well I'll come back.  What is that supposed to mean?  You're not willing to wait for me to come back?
Ses04F_impro02_M013	fru	Of course I'm going to wait.  I just- I just don't like the idea of this happening because this isn't the last time this is going to happen. You're going to go on more tours and stuff.  I just- I can't-
Ses04F_impro02_M014	fru	I can't deal with this emotionally.
Ses04F_impro02_F013	fru	What do you want me to do?
Ses04F_impro02_M015	fru	I want you to leave.  I want you to leave the service.
Ses04F_impro02_F014	fru	Well I can't very well do it today.  I still have to leave tomorrow.
Ses04F_impro02_M016	fru	You can do it today.  You don't have to do anything.  You don't have to do anything you don't want to do.
Ses04F_impro02_F015	fru	You're not making this any easier for me, you know.  I'm the one who has to go and you're really not helping.
Ses04F_impro02_M017	fru	Look I'm just telling you that you don't have to go.
Ses04F_impro02_F016	fru	I do have to go. And I need to know that you're here waiting for me and that you believe that I'm coming back.
Ses04F_impro02_M018	ang	That's all I'm saying... No you don't.
Ses04F_impro02_F017	ang	Thanks that helps.
Ses04F_impro02_M019	fru	It's just really unfair.  This is- this is bullshit.
Ses04F_impro02_F018	ang	I feel much better now.
Ses04F_impro02_M020	ang	You're acting like, you know, you're the one who's going all through, you know, all this shit and it's really- it's really not.
Ses04F_impro02_F019	fru	I know I'm leaving you here with all the responsibility but at least you get to be with her.
Ses04F_impro02_M021	ang	Yeah.  Of course I do because I didn't enlist in this stupid thing.  Why don't you just get out now and then-
Ses04F_impro02_F020	fru	I will but I can't right now.
Ses04F_impro02_M023	fru	Then go.  We'll be here when you get back.
Ses04F_impro02_F022	ang	That's how you want to leave it?
Ses04F_impro02_M024	sad	I don't know how else to leave it.  What, do you want me to lie to you?
Ses04F_impro02_M025	sad	You want me tell you that I'm okay with it?
Ses04F_impro02_F023	sad	I want you to be okay with it as much as you can be.  I mean it's not a great situation but we don't have an option here.
Ses04F_impro02_M026	sad	Well I can't be okay with it the same way you can't not go.  It just doesn't work that way.

Ses04F_impro03_M019	neu	It's a light brown, tanish.
Ses04F_impro03_M020	neu	I just think browns are really what you want to go with.  I mean I think there's more contrast between brown and green than there is-
Ses04F_impro03_M021	neu	I know but you just asked me to-
Ses04F_impro03_M023	fru	Come on.  Please will you do the greens and browns, just the browns for me?

Ses04F_impro03_M040	exc	Wow.  I just- I- I- I feel like I'm going to faint.
Ses04F_impro03_M041	exc	I'm so- all the blood
Ses04F_impro03_F044	exc	You don't look like you're going to faint.
Ses04F_impro03_M042	exc	has just rushed to my head, and I, and I mean honestly.
Ses04F_impro03_M043	exc	I'm getting a little weak in the knees.
Ses04F_impro03_F045	exc	So- So when are you getting married Mr. Excited?
Ses04F_impro03_F047	exc	You haven't ruined it yet.
Ses04F_impro03_F048	exc	You really like
Ses04F_impro03_M047	neu	I don't know.  Okay.  I mean gosh.  There's just- look there's a lot of pressure in getting married, okay.
Ses04F_impro03_F050	exc	You could make her that excited.  You really like her.  You guys have been together for a really long time now.
Ses04F_impro03_F051	exc	[LAUGHTER] That's more than I needed to know.
Ses04F_impro03_F052	exc	[laughter]
Ses04F_impro04_F000	neu	That's helpful.
Ses04F_impro04_F001	fru	I just don't think I can do this anymore.  It's been a really long time and it's not like I'm not trying.
Ses04F_impro04_M001	neu	Well I guess you're not trying hard enough.
Ses04F_impro04_F002	fru	I am try-  it's been three years
Ses04F_impro04_F003	fru	and I have gone everywhere I can think of.  I have given resumes.  I have done interviews.  I've tried to pull in favors.  I've asked everybody I know for help.  I don't know what else to do.
Ses04F_impro04_M002	neu	Just, I don't know, maybe you're not smart enough.
Ses04F_impro04_M003	neu	I mean I don't know just go out and keep trying. Just-
Ses04F_impro04_M004	neu	I don't know.
Ses04F_impro04_F004	fru	Okay but I've been trying for three years.  Three years and I haven't gotten a bite much less actually gotten hired, and I am smart enough.  Thank you very much.
Ses04F_impro04_M005	neu	Hey.  Look, I mean- you know.
Ses04F_impro04_F005	ang	I'm really good at what I do.  I just don't know how to make someone else see that.
Ses04F_impro04_M006	neu	Look bananas don't grow overnight.  Okay.
Ses04F_impro04_F006	ang	What?  Who says that?  Bananas don't grow overnight.
Ses04F_impro04_M007	neu	You need that- Time-
Ses04F_impro04_M008	neu	You know- You need to just- you need, I mean it takes time to get a good job.  I mean-
Ses04F_impro04_F007	fru	Okay.  I think three years is a little excessive.
Ses04F_impro04_M009	neu	look at me, like, you know. I mean, Hey, I- it took me, you know, like six years to get where I am now. I mean-
Ses04F_impro04_F008	ang	Yeah but you weren't unemployed for three years trying to find any job.  I mean at this point I'm going to go drive a cab or, you know, work at the gas station or something.  I don't even- I don't know what to do anymore.
Ses04F_impro04_M010	fru	I don't know.  I mean whatever.
Ses04F_impro04_F009	fru	Nothing I'm trying seems to work. Just-
Ses04F_impro04_F011	ang	Clearly everything you're doing is completely wrong.
Ses04F_impro04_M013	neu	I mean, well I mean i don't know; it doesn't really affect my life, you know.
Ses04F_impro04_F012	fru	Well don't you understand that this is-
Ses04F_impro04_M014	neu	Yeah, I understand, but-
Ses04F_impro04_F013	ang	I don't even- I mean you have to have some kind of an idea.  Something you could possibly throw out there that I could maybe use.
Ses04F_impro04_M015	neu	I don't know. Well like, I don't know. I mean-
Ses04F_impro04_F014	ang	I mean it's not like this is an
Ses04F_impro04_F015	ang	extreme request.  I want to find a job.  Everybody wants to find a job. It's really not that.
Ses04F_impro04_M016	neu	Clearly- cle- clearly you're doing something wrong.
Ses04F_impro04_F016	ang	Okay. Okay, Fine.
Ses04F_impro04_M017	neu	'Cause if you've been looking, you've been applying for jobs for three years. And-
Ses04F_impro04_F017	ang	Okey So I'm doing something wrong.  What am I doing wrong?
Ses04F_impro04_F018	ang	I'm really good at what I do.  I'm smart.  I'm trained.  I have the education.  I'm talented.  I cannot-
Ses04F_impro04_M018	neu	Are you- I mean do you like get dressed up and everything when you go to the job interview?
Ses04F_impro04_F019	fru	Well yeah I mean I like take a shower and stuff.
Ses04F_impro04_M019	neu	And you like- you know, you shave your legs and everything?
Ses04F_impro04_F020	fru	[LAUGHTER] Yeah.  Usually.
Ses04F_impro04_M020	neu	and I want- I mean you know you've got to, like, do your hair.  I mean- I don't know, it's like,
Ses04F_impro04_F021	fru	Yeah, I- I make my
Ses04F_impro04_F022	fru	I make myself very presentable before I go to any kind of interview.
Ses04F_impro04_M021	neu	you know what I mean? You know, it's like they say presentation is, like eighty percent.
Ses04F_impro04_M022	neu	or some- some large percent of- of success.
Ses04F_impro04_F023	fru	Uhuh. Uhuh. Yeah, yeah. Good quote.
Ses04F_impro04_M023	neu	Because I don't know I mean just, you know, just keep- keep- keep at it.  Keep trying.  Go-
Ses04F_impro04_F024	fru	Buck-O. That's really helpful.  Just keep chugging along.  The little engine that could.
Ses04F_impro04_F025	ang	Well you- just you're doing something wrong.
Ses04F_impro04_M025	fru	Look if I could give you a job,if I could give you a job I would but I mean I'm not in that position. I'm-
Ses04F_impro04_F026	fru	Well maybe you could help.  I mean you've got a job.  I'm willing to look outside of my realm.  I could try something else.
Ses04F_impro04_M026	neu	Hey, I'd love to help you but I- you don't have the kind of training that I-
Ses04F_impro04_F027	fru	I'll get it.  I just need a job.  I don't care what it is.
Ses04F_impro04_M027	fru	So, go to McDonalds.
Ses04F_impro04_F028	fru	Well I mean I need to make a little bit more than the minimum wage fry flipper.
Ses04F_impro04_M028	neu	Well you've got to start somewhere.  I mean-
Ses04F_impro04_F029	fru	I did start somewhere.  I worked my way up.  I'm not going to start at the bottom again.
Ses04F_impro04_M029	fru	Well you're going to have to.  You don't really have an option.  What's your problem?
Ses04F_impro04_F030	ang	What's my problem?  What's my problem? I don't have a job.
Ses04F_impro04_M030	neu	I don't know it's like I'm trying to be-
Ses04F_impro04_F031	ang	I thought I was pretty clear about what the problem was.
Ses04F_impro04_M031	neu	I'm trying to be helpful.
Ses04F_impro04_F032	fru	Well maybe you could be a little helpful.  I mean obviously you don't have any problems so would it really take so much time out of your day to just go ahead and help somebody else.
Ses04F_impro04_M033	neu	I'm trying to watch TV.
Ses04F_impro04_F033	fru	That's important.  That's really important.
Ses04F_impro05_M000	fru	Welcome to Northwest Airlines.  How can I help you?
Ses04F_impro05_F000	fru	You guys lost my bag.
Ses04F_impro05_M001	fru	Did you file a complaint already?
Ses04F_impro05_F001	fru	Yeah.  Yeah I did.
Ses04F_impro05_M002	fru	Where?  Did you do it at the front desk or by the baggage claims?
Ses04F_impro05_F002	fru	I-I don't know.  The place where they told me to go.  Look they told me to come talk to you because you guys lost my bag.  Not it's late.  Not it will be here soon, lost it completely.  What are you going to do about that?
Ses04F_impro05_M003	fru	Ma'am, first of all I'd like you to calm down.  Second of all-
Ses04F_impro05_F003	fru	Look that bag has my entire life in it and you just lost it.
Ses04F_impro05_F004	ang	Lost it just, like, I mean,
Ses04F_impro05_M005	fru	Ma'am, I understand that.
Ses04F_impro05_F005	ang	it's not like it just disappeared into thin air. Somebody wasn't paying attention
Ses04F_impro05_F006	ang	because my bag was very easy to keep track of.  It's got big, you know, rainbow colored crap all over it and no one was paying attention because now it's just gone.
Ses04F_impro05_M006	fru	I understand that.  The best I can do for you, at this moment, is give you fifty dollar check courtesy of Northwest Airlines for inconveniencing you in losing your luggage.
Ses04F_impro05_M007	fru	At this moment in time, all I can do for you is give you-
Ses04F_impro05_F008	ang	No. No. I heard- I heard what you said.
Ses04F_impro05_F009	ang	You're kidding me, right.  You're going to give me fifty dollars to completely cover my bag, everything that was in it, the inconvenience that I've gone through.  I paid for my ticket.  All I expect is to safely get to my destination with my stuff.  Is that so much to ask?  I mean I really don't think that's that big a deal to ask you guys to have my bag in the place where I leave and then put my bag where I end up.
Ses04F_impro05_M008	fru	you're getting very excited right now
Ses04F_impro05_F010	ang	Yeah, well that's got everything I have in it.
Ses04F_impro05_M009	fru	I understand that, ma'am but there's not really much I can do for you right now.
Ses04F_impro05_F011	ang	Look fifty dollars is unacceptable.  My bag itself cost over a hundred and fifty dollars.  You can't just give me fifty dollar gift certificate to Percoes or whatever the hell and then send me off like that's- that's good enough.  Like that's all I needed was fifty dollars.  My bag is worth more than that.
Ses04F_impro05_M010	fru	What I need you to do is file another complaint form. There's a form that you can fill out over by the front desk near the baggage claim.
Ses04F_impro05_M011	fru	If you'd like to take that over to the front desk- Ma'am.
Ses04F_impro05_M012	fru	We're just talking over each other.
Ses04F_impro05_M013	fru	We're not going to communicate anything this way.
Ses04F_impro05_F012	ang	I expect your airline who was responsible for my bag to give me the equivalent of the bag and all of the things in it.
Ses04F_impro05_M014	fru	Ma'am in flying with Northwest Airlines you agreed to
Ses04F_impro05_M015	fru	sign away your luggage to the
Ses04F_impro05_F013	ang	I didn't sign anything. I didn't sign anything. And you people have got to make-
Ses04F_impro05_M016	fru	It's part of the small- it's part of the agreement when you're purchasing an airline ticket, there's- when you-
Ses04F_impro05_F014	ang	You have to make amends for what you did for losing my bag and all of my stuff.  Fifty dollars is unacceptable.
Ses04F_impro05_M017	fru	Ma'am, please calm down.  When you purchase a ticket, there is a terms and agreement,
Ses04F_impro05_F015	ang	No.  No.  I don't know. You know what? I'm going to call my lawyer. You know what?  That's what I'm going to do.  I'm going to call my lawyer and have him get down here and explain to you that this is an unacceptable option.
Ses04F_impro05_M018	fru	terms and conditions- in the agreement of purchasing a ticket. Most people frequently look it over
Ses04F_impro05_M019	fru	The best that we can do for you is give you-
Ses04F_impro05_M020	fru	Ma'am.
Ses04F_impro05_F016	ang	I want to talk to your supervisor.
Ses04F_impro05_M021	fru	I am- I am- I am my own supervisor.
Ses04F_impro05_F017	ang	I've had enough.  I want to talk to-no, no unacceptable I want to your supervisor. I am done with this.
Ses04F_impro05_M022	fru	I am the supervisor, ma'am.
Ses04F_impro05_F018	ang	Really, you don't work for anybody.  It's just you?
Ses04F_impro05_M023	fru	I am the current manager on duty.
Ses04F_impro05_F019	ang	Okay.  Well I want to call whoever you report to, whoever your boss is because I have had enough with this airline and I am finished waiting for my fifty dollar gift certificate.
Ses04F_impro06_M000	sad	Hey, I'm, uh. I'm really sorry about what happened.  I don't um- I mean what you can you do?  I mean it's-
Ses04F_impro06_F000	sad	Thanks.
Ses04F_impro06_M001	sad	When I was seven, my- my grandmother died and I really- I don't know, I mean it was really hard to let go but the important thing is- is that you do let go and your realize that, you know, they- you know, they- this person had fun while they were- while they were here and, uh, you know, you work- you work through it.
Ses04F_impro06_F001	sad	You know it's just, I just, you know, I mean it just happened.  I just, like- I just keep expecting him to walk in, you know.
Ses04F_impro06_M002	sad	Mmhmm. Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean it's- it's hard.  It's hard.
Ses04F_impro06_F002	sad	I just- I just thought he would have longer, you know, because I'm- I mean when he found out he was sick, we knew that wasn't good but I just- I just thought that it would take longer, you know?
Ses04F_impro06_M003	sad	Yeah.
Ses04F_impro06_M004	neu	Well I mean, you know, I mean it was I mean with that kind of condition,
Ses04F_impro06_F003	sad	Yeah. I know. I know.
Ses04F_impro06_M005	sad	you know, it's inevitable  and I mean honestly it's- it's almost like
Ses04F_impro06_M006	neu	you know, you don't- you know, how long do you want the person to go through that, you know.
Ses04F_impro06_M007	neu	It's sort of- it's almost better off to rest in peace than he is to live in pain.
Ses04F_impro06_F004	sad	Yeah, I know. But I'd rather have him here with me, you know. It's just not fair.  I mean he- he didn't get to do like anything. I mean he was-
Ses04F_impro06_F005	sad	He was only twenty four and just so many things that we were going to do, you know, and now he won't get to do them and he won't get to be here when I do.  You know, like I'll get married some day and he won't be there, like, he won't get to see that.
Ses04F_impro06_M008	sad	Yeah.
Ses04F_impro06_F006	sad	It just doesn't seem fair.
Ses04F_impro06_M009	sad	It's not fair but I mean that's, you know, the course of life is that, you know, you meet people and you lose them.
Ses04F_impro06_M010	sad	You're okay
Ses04F_impro06_F007	sad	Thank you for being here.
Ses04F_impro06_M011	sad	You know I think- I think we should celebrate because I think that's what he would have wanted.
Ses04F_impro06_F008	hap	[LAUGHTER] You're probably right.  He probably would be pissed if we were all sitting around being upset about it. He'd want us to have a party.
Ses04F_impro06_M012	neu	Yeah.
Ses04F_impro06_F009	hap	And to drink in his honor. [LAUGHTER]
Ses04F_impro06_M013	sad	That's right.  That's right.  I mean he would want us to, you know, celebrate the life that he- that he lived and, you know, enjoy the rest of ours as much as we can.
Ses04F_impro06_F010	sad	Yeah, I know.
Ses04F_impro06_M014	sad	So-
Ses04F_impro07_M000	neu	Hey, what's up?
Ses04F_impro07_F000	exc	Guess what came today?

Ses04F_impro07_F009	exc	The campus is beautiful. I'm so excited.
Ses04F_impro07_M009	neu	I know but you should get like a taser or something.  I mean walking around the campus at night-
Ses04F_impro07_F010	exc	Do you want to buy me some mace for my, you know, going away present?
Ses04F_impro07_F011	exc	There we go.  Perfect.
Ses04F_impro07_F012	exc	And a taser.  Excellent.  Just make sure it's a big knife.
Ses04F_impro07_F013	exc	I don't want any of those little puny ones.
Ses04F_impro07_M013	neu	So, um- so what are you going to- what are you going to major in?
Ses04F_impro07_F014	exc	Well I was thinking maybe underwater basket weaving.
Ses04F_impro07_F015	exc	U.S.C. has a major in that, right.
Ses04F_impro07_F016	exc	They have - U.S.C. has everything because U.S.C. is the best school ever.
Ses04F_impro07_M016	neu	they have that as a major?
Ses04F_impro07_M017	neu	That's ridiculous.  I don't believe that.
Ses04F_impro07_F017	exc	Okay.  Well I'm lying but-
Ses04F_impro07_M018	neu	Seriously, what's your major?
Ses04F_impro07_F018	exc	Well, I haven't decided yet.  I want to try some things out.
Ses04F_impro07_M019	neu	So you're undecided?

Ses04F_impro07_M071	neu	Yeah, you don't want to do the sorority thing because you'll probably get used and abused by
Ses04F_impro07_M072	neu	lots of drunk frat boys

Ses04F_impro07_F070	exc	What have you heard about the Greek system?

Ses04F_impro07_M079	neu	I hate to break this to you but you meet people by being cool, so-
Ses04F_impro07_F074	exc	Oh, oh, I'm sorry, my bad.  I'll have to, like, sign up for summer lessons from you before I go.  You can teach me how to be cool before I go to college.
Ses04F_impro07_M080	neu	No, no, no.  You're right though.  I mean, you know, dorms are definitely the way to meet people.  I know that I was in an apartment off campus
Ses04F_impro07_M082	neu	that happened, you know, that was going on.
Ses04F_impro07_F078	exc	That's what you're saying. I'm right. [LAUGHTER]

Ses04F_impro08_F001	neu	Okay.  Well, Did you go through the automated menu?  Most of your requests can be taken care of through that.
Ses04F_impro08_M003	fru	Yes, I did and that didn't- I got through to, like, one operator and she sent me to like three others
Ses04F_impro08_F002	neu	Okay.  Well I'd be happy to-

Ses04F_impro08_F005	neu	Okay.  Um, and what was the complaint?
Ses04F_impro08_M007	fru	The food was prepared incorrectly.
Ses04F_impro08_M008	fru	I asked for no tomatoes.
Ses04F_impro08_F006	neu	Can you be a little more specific, sir?
Ses04F_impro08_F007	fru	Did you try to take them back and get your order fixed, sir?
Ses04F_impro08_F008	neu	Well I'm very sorry, sir.  They should have dealt with it at that particular branch.  I apologize for that, uh, but we can help you.  That's no worries.  We can take care of that.  So how much did you need to be refunded?

Ses04F_impro08_M013	ang	Look, I don't want to be transferred over to another- All I want to do is just give you my name and address so you can send me a check.
Ses04F_impro08_M014	ang	Okay.  You understand that's all I want. Just don't give me a problem with this.  Okay, please because I'm very sensitive right now
Ses04F_impro08_M015	ang	and if I get sent to another operator, I'll have to tell them the same damn story again.  I don't- I think I'm just going to lose my mind.  So if you could please just not do that, that would be great.  Thank you.
Ses04F_impro08_F010	fru	I understand, sir.  I will explain to them what the situa-
Ses04F_impro08_M016	ang	You don't understand because you've never gone to Del Taco and gotten the service that I've gotten.  You don't understand.
Ses04F_impro08_M017	ang	You're not going to call the other operator. You're not going to call the the other operator.
Ses04F_impro08_M018	ang	You're going to fill out a form on your desk
Ses04F_impro08_M019	ang	because I know you're at a desk right now in your stupid corporate building and you're going to send me a check for sixteen dollars and forty two cents.
Ses04F_impro08_F012	fru	Okay, sir.  They- they have to-
Ses04F_impro08_F013	fru	Sir.

Ses04F_impro08_F017	fru	Sir, I don't think my name is really relevant-
Ses04F_impro08_M023	ang	Cindy, look.  If you don't get your ass a piece of paper that has a check
Ses04F_impro08_M024	ang	attached to it and you don't send it to me, I'm going to get very upset.
Ses04F_impro08_F018	fru	Alright, sir. Sir.  I'm going to transfer you to the address.
Ses04F_impro08_F019	fru	Alright.  You know what, sir.  The customer is always right.

Ses04F_impro08_F020	fru	I will go ahead and I will take- I will take

Ses04F_impro08_M027	fru	Send me to whatever operator. I just- You know what?  I'm just done.  I'm just done.  I've lost all hope.

Ses04F_impro08_F024	fru	Okay.  If that's what you want, you want to go to the next person?
Ses04F_impro08_F025	fru	Okay.  Great.
Ses04F_script01_1_M000	neu	He saw it.
Ses04F_script01_1_F004	sad	Did you talk to him?
Ses04F_script01_1_M004	sad	No, I figured the best thing was to leave him alone.
Ses04F_script01_1_M005	sad	I could hear him right through the floor of my room.
Ses04F_script01_1_F006	fru	What was he doing out here at that hour?  He's dreaming about him again.  He's walking around at night.
Ses04F_script01_1_M007	fru	I don't know the meaning of this, mom.  But I know one thing you made a terrible mistake with dad.
Ses04F_script01_1_M008	fru	Being dishonest with him, that kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.
Ses04F_script01_1_M009	ang	You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?
Ses04F_script01_1_F011	ang	What do you want to do, argue with him?
Ses04F_script01_1_M010	ang	I don't want to argue with him but it's time that he realizes that Larry's not coming back anymore.
Ses04F_script01_1_F012	ang	You can't say that to him.
Ses04F_script01_1_M012	ang	We've got to say it to him.
Ses04F_script01_1_F013	ang	How are you going to prove it?  Can you prove it?
Ses04F_script01_1_M013	ang	For God's sake three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane.
Ses04F_script01_1_F014	ang	To you it is and to me but not to him.  You can talk yourself blue in the face but there's no body and no grave so where are you?
Ses04F_script01_1_M014	fru	Sit down mom.  I want to talk to you.
Ses04F_script01_1_F015	ang	The trouble is the goddamn newspapers.  Every month some boy turns up from nowhere so the next one is going to be Larry.
Ses04F_script01_1_M015	fru	Alright, alright, alright.  Listen. You know why I asked Annie here don't you?
Ses04F_script01_1_M016	neu	You know why.
Ses04F_script01_1_M017	neu	I'm going to ask her to marry me.
Ses04F_script01_1_F018	neu	Well that's only your business, Chris.
Ses04F_script01_1_M018	fru	You know it's not only my business.
Ses04F_script01_1_F019	ang	What do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind.
Ses04F_script01_1_M019	fru	Then it's alright.  I'll go ahead with it.
Ses04F_script01_1_M020	ang	Then it isn't just my business.
Ses04F_script01_1_F021	fru	I'm just saying.
Ses04F_script01_1_M021	ang	Sometimes you infuriate me.  You know that?  Isn't it your business too if I tell this to father and he throws a fit about it.
Ses04F_script01_1_M022	ang	Sometimes you have a- Sometimes you have a talent for ignoring things.
Ses04F_script01_1_F022	ang	I ignore what I got to ignore. The girl is Larry's girl.
Ses04F_script01_1_M023	fru	She's not Larry's girl.
Ses04F_script01_1_F023	ang	From father's point of view, he's not dead and you have no right to take his girl.
Ses04F_script01_1_F024	ang	Now you can go on from there and you know where to go, but I'm telling you I don't know where to go.  See I don't know.  Now what can I do for you?
Ses04F_script01_1_M024	fru	I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something I want, I have to pull back because other people will suffer. My whole bloody life time after time after time.
Ses04F_script01_1_F025	neu	You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong in that.
Ses04F_script01_1_M025	ang	To hell with that.
Ses04F_script01_1_M026	sad	I wanted to get this settled first.
Ses04F_script01_1_F027	fru	How do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way father does.
Ses04F_script01_1_M027	fru	Well if she does, then that's the end of it.  From her letters, I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out.
Ses04F_script01_1_M028	ang	and then we'll thrash it out with dad, right mom.  Don't avoid me.
Ses04F_script01_1_F028	fru	The trouble is you don't see enough women.  You never did.
Ses04F_script01_1_M029	ang	So what I'm not fast with women.
Ses04F_script01_1_F029	ang	I don't see why it has to be Annie.
Ses04F_script01_1_M030	ang	Because it is.
Ses04F_script01_1_F030	ang	Well that's a good answer but it don't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you went to war.  It's been five years.
Ses04F_script01_1_M032	sad	These years when I think of someone for my wife, I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram?
Ses04F_script01_1_F031	fru	I don't want a diagram.  He thinks he's coming back, Chris.
Ses04F_script01_1_F032	ang	You marry that girl.  You're pronouncing him dead.  Now what happens to your father?  Do you know because I don't?
Ses04F_script01_1_M034	ang	I've given it three years of thought.  I hoped that if I waited, dad would forget about Larry
Ses04F_script01_1_M035	fru	and everything would be happy and we would have a regular wedding.  But if that can't happen here, then I'll have to get out.
Ses04F_script01_1_F035	ang	Are you crazy?
Ses04F_script01_1_F036	ang	You've got a business here.  What the hell is this?
Ses04F_script01_1_M038	ang	The business, the business doesn't inspire me.
Ses04F_script01_1_F037	ang	Must you be inspired?
Ses04F_script01_1_M039	fru	Yes, I like it an hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, at least at evening I want it beautiful.
Ses04F_script01_1_M040	fru	I want- I want a family.  I want some kids.  I want to build something I give myself to.  Annie is in the middle of that.  Now where do I find it?
Ses04F_script01_1_F038	fru	You mean-tell me something you mean you'd really leave the business?
Ses04F_script01_1_M042	fru	Then you help me stay here.
Ses04F_script01_1_F040	ang	Alright but don't think that way
Ses04F_script01_1_F041	ang	because what the hell did we work for?  This whole shooting match is just for you, Chris.
Ses04F_script01_1_M043	fru	I know.  Just you help me stay here.
Ses04F_script01_1_F042	ang	But don't think that way.  You hear me?
Ses04F_script01_1_F044	ang	Yeah.  I can see that.
Ses04F_script01_2_F000	ang	Why did he invite her?
Ses04F_script01_2_M000	neu	Why does that bother you?
Ses04F_script01_2_F001	ang	It's been three years.  Why all of a sudden?
Ses04F_script01_2_M001	neu	Well maybe- maybe he just wanted to see her again.
Ses04F_script01_2_F002	fru	Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.
Ses04F_script01_2_M004	neu	How do you know he's even thinking about it?
Ses04F_script01_2_F005	ang	What's going on here, Joe?
Ses04F_script01_2_M006	fru	Listen kid.
Ses04F_script01_2_F006	ang	No, line.
Ses04F_script01_2_M007	neu	Uh, Then why is she still-she's not his girl, Joe
Ses04F_script01_2_F007	ang	She's not his girl, Joe.  She knows she's not.
Ses04F_script01_2_M008	neu	You can't read her mind.
Ses04F_script01_2_F008	ang	Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men.  Why hasn't she married?
Ses04F_script01_2_F009	ang	Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish but she's waited.
Ses04F_script01_2_M009	fru	How do you know why she waited?
Ses04F_script01_2_F010	ang	Because she knows what I know that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.
Ses04F_script01_2_F011	fru	In my worst moments, I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right.
Ses04F_script01_2_M010	fru	Look it's a nice day.  What are we arguing for?
Ses04F_script01_2_F012	fru	Nobody in this house dares take her faith away, Joe.  Strangers might but not his father, not his brother.
Ses04F_script01_2_M011	fru	What do you want me to do?
Ses04F_script01_2_M012	fru	But Kate-
Ses04F_script01_2_F014	fru	Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.
Ses04F_script01_2_F016	ang	She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look, look at it.  Joe-
Ses04F_script01_2_M013	fru	Calm yourself.
Ses04F_script01_2_F017	fru	Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand alone.
Ses04F_script01_2_M014	fru	Calm yourself.
Ses04F_script01_2_F018	fru	Just last week a man showed up in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  You read it yourself.
Ses04F_script01_2_M015	fru	Alright.  Alright.  Calm yourself.
Ses04F_script01_2_F019	fru	You above all have got to believe.  You.
Ses04F_script01_2_M016	fru	Why me above all?
Ses04F_script01_2_F020	fru	Just don't stop believing.
Ses04F_script01_2_M017	ang	What does that mean, me above all?  Look at you.  You're shaking.
Ses04F_script01_2_F021	fru	I can't help it.
Ses04F_script01_2_M018	fru	What have I got to hide?  What the hell is matter with you Kate?
Ses04F_script01_3_M004	ang	What?
Ses04F_script01_3_M008	neu	I guess you know this is why I asked you to come.
Ses04F_script01_3_F009	hap	I guess this is why I came.
Ses04F_script01_3_M009	hap	Ann, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you.
Ses04F_script01_3_M010	hap	I have no imagination that's all I know to tell you.
Ses04F_script01_3_M011	hap	I'm embarrassing you.  I didn't want to tell it to you here.  I
Ses04F_script01_3_F010	hap	Chris, I've been ready a long, long time.
Ses04F_script01_3_M014	neu	And he's gone forever.  You're sure?
Ses04F_script01_3_F012	hap	You started to write me.
Ses04F_script01_3_F013	hap	Every day since.
Ses04F_script01_3_F014	hap	I was waiting for you, Chris.  Till then you never wrote and then when you did what did you say.  I mean you sure can be ambiguous you know.
Ses04F_script01_3_M018	hap	Give me a kiss, Ann.  Give me a-God I kissed you.
Ses04F_script01_3_M019	hap	I kissed Annie.  How long, how long I've been waiting to kiss you.
Ses04F_script01_3_F015	hap	I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I've done is sit and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.
Ses04F_script01_3_M020	hap	Annie, we're going to live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.
Ses04F_script01_3_M023	sad	No, nothing like that.
Ses04F_script01_3_M024	sad	Yes.  I suppose I have been but it's going from me.
Ses04F_script01_3_M025	fru	I don't know where to start.
Ses04F_script01_3_M026	sad	There's so many things mixed up.
Ses04F_script01_3_M027	sad	You remember overseas I was in command of a company?
Ses04F_script01_3_F023	neu	Yeah, sure.
Ses04F_script01_3_M028	sad	Well I lost them.
Ses04F_script01_3_F024	sad	How many?
Ses04F_script01_3_M029	sad	Just about all.
Ses04F_script01_3_M030	sad	It takes a lot of time to toss that off because they weren't just men.
Ses04F_script01_3_M031	sad	For instance, one time it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.
Ses04F_script01_3_M032	sad	I put them in my pocket. that's only a little thing but these are the kind of guys I had.
Ses04F_script01_3_M033	sad	They didn't die.  They killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today.
Ses04F_script01_3_M034	sad	And I got this idea watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed see, but it seemed to me that there was one new thing that was made
Ses04F_script01_3_M035	sad	a sort of responsibility man for man.  You understand me?
Ses04F_script01_3_M036	sad	And then I came home and it was amazing.
Ses04F_script01_3_M039	sad	I felt, what you said, ashamed somehow
Ses04F_script01_3_M040	sad	because nobody was changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.
Ses04F_script01_3_M041	sad	I felt wrong to be alive, to open the new bank book, to drive the new car, to see the new refrigerator.
Ses04F_script01_3_M043	sad	when you drive the new car, you have to know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've got to be a little better because of that.
Ses04F_script01_3_M044	sad	Otherwise what you have is really just loot and there's blood on it.  I didn't want to take any of it.
Ses04F_script01_3_M045	sad	I guess that included you.
Ses04F_script01_3_M047	hap	Annie, Annie I'm going to make a fortune for you.
Ses04F_script01_3_F030	hap	What'll I do with a fortune?
Ses04F_script02_1_M000	hap	What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.  This is great isn't it?  Look at this night we've got here.  It couldn't be better.
Ses04F_script02_1_F000	neu	Fine.
Ses04F_script02_1_M002	exc	Is that, is that-that's just foam isn't it?  I can't even tell
Ses04F_script02_1_M004	fru	Oh, no you know what I did?  I forgot my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid I forgot my flashlight.
Ses04F_script02_1_M005	fru	The flashlight, the silver one.  There's only one isn't there?
Ses04F_script02_1_F002	fru	It's not yours.
Ses04F_script02_1_M007	fru	Well sure.
Ses04F_script02_1_M008	fru	No of course our flashlight, yours and mine, mi flashlight es su flashlight naturally.  How could we not think to bring it?
Ses04F_script02_1_M009	exc	I hope the moon stays out.  I wonder do they always run during a full moon.  I can't remember if it was full last year.  Remember?
Ses04F_script02_1_M010	neu	Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  We should have brought the blanket, our blanket.
Ses04F_script02_1_M011	hap	Ah, this is great, isn't it?  I didn't even think to bring a six-pack.  A six-pack would be just the ticket right about now.
Ses04F_script02_1_F007	ang	It's after eleven let's go home.
Ses04F_script02_1_M015	fru	Are you kidding?  We'd miss it.  We just got here.  What's the point of coming down here if we just turn around and go home?
Ses04F_script02_1_F008	ang	There is no point in coming down here.
Ses04F_script02_1_M016	fru	Right.
Ses04F_script02_1_F009	fru	That's my point.
Ses04F_script02_1_M017	neu	That's my point too.
Ses04F_script02_1_F010	fru	So let's go home.
Ses04F_script02_1_M018	fru	No, no, no.  That's not my point.  My point is is that there's no point in coming down here if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it?
Ses04F_script02_1_F011	fru	Not particularly.
Ses04F_script02_1_F012	ang	I just don't.  It's stupid.
Ses04F_script02_1_M020	fru	Honey this is natural phenomenon.  I mean this only happens once a year.  This is a great opportunity.
Ses04F_script02_1_M021	exc	Think about the people in Kansas.  They'd have to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to come see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up.
Ses04F_script02_1_F013	ang	Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, flop around, and then swim away and then they die.
Ses04F_script02_1_M022	fru	Yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping around is laying eggs or what do you, spawning or mating something like that.
Ses04F_script02_1_M023	exc	This is the big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy.
Ses04F_script02_1_F014	ang	What are you so excited about?  This isn't a moon landing we're talking about.  It's fish.  It's fish nobody even eats.
Ses04F_script02_1_M024	fru	Yeah, they do.
Ses04F_script02_1_F015	fru	Oh, Augie.
Ses04F_script02_1_M025	fru	Okay but it's fish who do something none of the other fish do
Ses04F_script02_1_M026	exc	like the swallows returning to Capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs, like that.  There's mystery here and magic
Ses04F_script02_1_M027	fru	a little bit of the unexplainable.  I don't see how you cannot be interested.
Ses04F_script02_1_F016	ang	I'm just not.
Ses04F_script02_1_F017	ang	Yes.
Ses04F_script02_1_M029	fru	I don't get it.  The first time we came here to see it you said it was the best night of your life and last year I remember distinctly you were so excited to get here.  You stubbed your toe rushing me out the door and didn't even notice until we were in the car.
Ses04F_script02_1_M030	fru	We weren't in a good spot.
Ses04F_script02_1_F019	ang	We didn't see them the first time either.
Ses04F_script02_1_M031	ang	We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.
Ses04F_script02_1_M032	exc	I've got good instincts for these things.  Look there. What's that.  Is that?  Is that, is that-no it's just seaweed isn't it.
Ses04F_script02_1_M033	exc	Ah, man this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  I mean think about this.  I know you're not interested but just think about this for a minute.
Ses04F_script02_1_M034	exc	Out there someplace there's this huge mass of silver fish heading this way.  They don't know why.  We don't know why.  It wasn't a decision.  They didn't take a vote.
Ses04F_script02_1_M035	exc	No one sent them a map or an invitation.  Just some little instinctual time release firecracker went off in their little bodies and all as one. They turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.
Ses04F_script02_1_M036	exc	They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters.
Ses04F_script02_1_M037	exc	It's single mindedness with no mind.  Urgency that's pure urge.
Ses04F_script02_1_M038	exc	They don't know what drives them.  They don't give it a name or ask question.  They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them here to this place
Ses04F_script02_1_M039	exc	where we stand for massive celebration of sex and death.
Ses04F_script02_1_M040	exc	Ah, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  All my hairs are popping up.
Ses04F_script02_1_F020	fru	That's the wind.
Ses04F_script02_1_F021	ang	About what?
Ses04F_script02_1_F022	ang	It's ridiculous.
Ses04F_script02_2_M000	neu	Well, so what do you think?
Ses04F_script02_2_F002	ang	It's PR.  Somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to take place on the beach.
Ses04F_script02_2_F005	ang	Goddamn it Augie don't ask me that.  You always ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  It's insulting.
Ses04F_script02_2_M006	fru	Well then what's bugging you?
Ses04F_script02_2_F006	ang	We just have different ideas about what this evening is supposed to look like.
Ses04F_script02_2_M007	fru	There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunions arrive.  They do their little fish business.  We go oh, ah look at the fish.  They go home.  We go home.
Ses04F_script02_2_F007	ang	For heaven's sake, this is not about fish.
Ses04F_script02_2_M008	fru	Why not?
Ses04F_script02_2_F008	neu	We totally skipped. Right.
Ses04F_script02_2_F009	ang	For heaven's sake, grow up we are not going to see the Grunions.
Ses04F_script02_2_M010	fru	Why not?
Ses04F_script02_2_F010	ang	We never do.  Do we have we ever?
Ses04F_script02_2_M011	fru	We've missed them twice that's not ever.
Ses04F_script02_2_F011	ang	Twice is every time we've tried that's ever.
Ses04F_script02_2_M012	fru	We'll see them this year.
Ses04F_script02_2_F014	ang	and the fish won't show up.
Ses04F_script02_2_M013	fru	I thought you wanted to see it.
Ses04F_script02_2_F015	fru	You don't understand anything I'm saying.
Ses04F_script02_2_M014	fru	No, of course not.
Ses04F_script02_2_F016	fru	I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking that this time will be the time but it never is.
Ses04F_script02_2_M015	fru	It's just a fish.  Nothing to get traumatized over.
Ses04F_script02_2_M016	fru	I've been trying to work this backwards but I can't seem to pinpoint the moment when we took a turn for the worse.  You were fine during the phone call from Marge.  Dinner was okay.  Doing the dishes was no problem.
Ses04F_script02_2_F019	sad	We thought I was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  So we took off our shoes
Ses04F_script02_2_F020	sad	and you popped the cork and while we were dancing, you said the softest most intimate things to me
Ses04F_script02_2_F021	sad	right into my ear so that I could hear them as much as- so that I could feel them as much as hear them.
Ses04F_script02_2_F022	sad	And I remember thinking this is it.  At last, at last I'm as happy as I'm supposed to be.
Ses04F_script02_2_M019	neu	Wait a minute.  I've got it.
Ses04F_script02_2_F023	sad	Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne from the bottle.
Ses04F_script02_2_M020	neu	It was in the car right.  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said let's get some champagne and I said times a wasting or something like that.  Right?
Ses04F_script02_2_M021	exc	That's it, right?  You want this to be like the other time, right.  That's it.
Ses04F_script02_2_F024	sad	I would rather not remember some things.  I would rather not hope for some things.
Ses04F_script02_2_F025	neu	No.
Ses04F_script02_2_M023	neu	You want me to get some champagne?
Ses04F_script02_2_F026	sad	No.
Ses04F_script02_2_F027	fru	No.  No.
Ses04F_script02_2_M025	fru	Well what?  Want me to breath in your ear?
Ses04F_script02_2_F028	fru	No.
Ses04F_script02_2_M026	fru	Want to get married again?
Ses04F_script02_2_F029	fru	No.
Ses04F_script02_2_M027	fru	What?  What do you want a divorce?
Ses04F_script02_2_F030	fru	No.
Ses04F_script02_2_M028	fru	A vacation?
Ses04F_script02_2_F031	ang	No.
Ses04F_script02_2_M029	fru	A new carpet, a poodle, a backrub, ice cream, a suicide pact.  What?  What?  Carla what the hell do you want?
Ses04F_script02_2_M031	fru	Do you think that when I proposed, I had this great fantasy going that four years down the line we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish.
Ses04F_script02_2_M032	fru	Do you think that I knew that there'd be times when you'd look at me like I'm a used Kleenex and times I would look at you and think holy hell when's the next flight to Alaska.
Ses04F_script02_2_M033	fru	No, no I'm just like you.  I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and sand in our hair and wind in our
Ses04F_script02_2_M034	fru	Sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will always pay themselves and ha, ha baby the jokes on us.  Because you know what you get,
Ses04F_script02_2_F033	ang	This what, what is this?  This isn't even anything.
Ses04F_script02_2_F034	ang	Oh, right, sure this is standing on the beach.  This is waiting.  This is fighting.
Ses04F_script02_2_M039	fru	I'm doing the best I can.
Ses04F_script02_2_F037	sad	I know you are, Augie.  Really I do.  I know you wanted this to be special and nice and it's the full moon and the sand and all but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.
Ses04F_script02_2_M040	sad	Maybe if you were with somebody else too.
Ses04F_script02_2_F038	fru	I didn't say that.
Ses04F_script02_2_M041	sad	No, I know but still.  I know I don't make you happy.
Ses04F_script02_2_F039	fru	For heaven's sake, whatever I'm doing I'd rather be doing it with you.
Ses04F_script02_2_F040	fru	Well don't be ridiculous.  Don't you know that?  You're the one who probably wishes you were with somebody else
Ses04F_script02_2_F041	sad	somebody who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard.
Ses04F_script02_2_M043	neu	Actually now that you mention it, no I don't.
Ses04F_script02_2_M044	neu	I don't know.  It seemed like a good spot to me.
Ses04F_script02_2_F043	hap	Yeah, I noticed that.  Looks pretty on the water doesn't it, big old white moon.
Ses04F_script02_2_M046	exc	Well look at what we got here.
Ses04F_script02_2_F044	hap	Oh, Augie you brought refreshments.
Ses04F_script02_2_M047	neu	It's not champagne.
Ses04F_script02_2_F045	hap	Well then I guess we don't need glasses.
Ses04F_script02_2_F046	hap	I'm beginning to think you might be right.  I think this may be the spot after all.  Augie I'm sorry.
Ses04F_script03_1_F005	exc	Ahh.  It sent shivers up my spine.
Ses04F_script03_1_M006	exc	What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us?
Ses04F_script03_1_F006	exc	Behave exquisitely.
Ses04F_script03_1_M007	exc	With the most perfect poise.
Ses04F_script03_1_F007	exc	Certainly I shall probably do a court curtsy.
Ses04F_script03_1_M008	exc	Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy, do they?
Ses04F_script03_1_M009	neu	Don't say that, my darling.
Ses04F_script03_1_F009	exc	It's true the whole business is very poor joke.
Ses04F_script03_1_F011	exc	Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious.
Ses04F_script03_1_F012	neu	Who's they?
Ses04F_script03_1_F014	exc	Oh, how long will it last, this ludicrous, over-bearing love of ours?
Ses04F_script03_1_M017	neu	Well who knows?
Ses04F_script03_1_F017	neu	What happens if one of us dies?  Does the one that's left still laugh?
Ses04F_script03_1_F021	exc	Thank you, dear.  The same applies to you except that if I catch you so much as looking at another woman, I'll kill you.
Ses04F_script03_1_M027	neu	Do you remember that awful scene in Venice?
Ses04F_script03_1_F022	exc	Which particular one?
Ses04F_script03_1_M028	neu	The one where you bought that little painted wooden snake and put it on my bed.
Ses04F_script03_1_F023	exc	Oh, Charles.  That was his name.  Charles he did wriggle so beautifully.
Ses04F_script03_1_M029	neu	Horrible thing.  I hated it.
Ses04F_script03_1_F024	exc	Yes, I know you did.  You threw him out of the window into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.
Ses04F_script03_1_M030	neu	How long did that row last?
Ses04F_script03_1_M031	neu	The worst one was in Cannes when your curling irons burnt holes in my dressing gown.
Ses04F_script03_1_F026	exc	It burnt my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.
Ses04F_script03_1_F028	exc	Then the manager came in and found us rolling about on the floor biting and scratching like panthers.
Ses04F_script03_1_F029	exc	How ridiculous.  How utterly, utterly ridiculous.
Ses04F_script03_1_F030	exc	And very much sillier.
Ses04F_script03_2_M000	neu	As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.
Ses04F_script03_2_M001	ang	I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.
Ses04F_script03_2_M003	ang	You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.
Ses04F_script03_2_M005	ang	You let him kiss you.  You said you did.
Ses04F_script03_2_F005	ang	What of it?
Ses04F_script03_2_M006	ang	What of it?
Ses04F_script03_2_M007	ang	What about me?
Ses04F_script03_2_M008	ang	That's a nice point of view, I must say.
Ses04F_script03_2_F008	fru	Oh, dear.  I'm bored with this conversation.
Ses04F_script03_2_F009	fru	No thanks.
Ses04F_script03_2_M010	neu	I'll have some myself, I think.
Ses04F_script03_2_M012	fru	You can hardly call three liquor glasses in the whole evening going on and on and on.
Ses04F_script03_2_F012	ang	It's become a habit with you.
Ses04F_script03_2_F013	ang	Oh, don't be so stupid.
Ses04F_script03_2_M014	ang	Really, Amanda.
Ses04F_script03_2_F014	ang	What?
Ses04F_script03_2_M015	ang	Nothing.
Ses04F_script03_2_M016	ang	Going somewhere, my dear?
Ses04F_script03_2_F015	fru	Just making myself fascinating for you.
Ses04F_script03_2_F016	fru	The woman's job is to allure the man.  Watch me a minute will you.
Ses04F_script03_2_F017	fru	Oh, no it isn't
Ses04F_script03_2_F019	ang	It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.
Ses04F_script03_2_M021	fru	Snap, snap, snap like a little adder.
Ses04F_script03_2_F020	ang	Adders don't snap they sting.
Ses04F_script03_2_F021	ang	They sting.
Ses04F_script03_2_F022	ang	I don't care, okay.  Do you understand?  I don't care.  I don't mind if they bark and roll about like hoops.
Ses04F_script03_2_M024	neu	Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?
Ses04F_script03_2_F023	ang	Yes, I did quite a lot.
Ses04F_script03_2_F024	ang	Mind your own business.
Ses04F_script03_2_F025	ang	You're quite insufferable.  I expect it's because you're drunk.
Ses04F_script03_2_M027	ang	I'm not in the least drunk.
Ses04F_script03_2_F026	ang	You always had a weak head.
Ses04F_script03_2_M028	fru	I think I mentioned once before that I had three minute liquor glasses of brandy the whole evening long.  A child of two couldn't get drunk on that.
Ses04F_script03_2_F027	ang	On, the contrary.  A child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.
Ses04F_script03_2_F028	ang	Oh, shut up.
Ses04F_script03_2_F029	ang	Not very funny, dear.  You'd better have some more brandy.
Ses04F_script03_2_M031	ang	Very good idea.  I will.
Ses04F_script03_2_F030	ang	Why?
Ses04F_script03_2_F031	ang	There is no one upstairs.  It's a photographer's studio.
Ses04F_script03_2_M034	ang	There are people downstairs I suppose.
Ses04F_script03_2_M035	ang	This is no time of year for Tunis.
Ses04F_script03_2_F034	ang	Very well if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.
Ses04F_script03_2_M037	ang	Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.
Ses04F_script03_2_F035	ang	You're far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.
Ses04F_script03_2_F036	ang	Go away, go away.  I hate you.
Ses04F_script03_2_M039	ang	Amanda, listen.
Ses04F_script03_2_F037	ang	Listen? Listen indeed.  I'm sick and tired of listening to you.  You damn sadistic bully.
Ses04F_script03_2_F038	ang	Stop.
Ses04F_script03_2_M040	ang	Very amusing.
Ses04F_script03_2_F039	ang	Stop, stop.  I hate you.  Do you hear?  You're conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.
Ses04F_script03_2_M041	ang	You're a vile tempered, loose living, wicked little beast. And I hope I never see you again as long as I live.
Ses04F_script03_2_F040	ang	This is the end do you understand?  The end,
Ses04F_script03_2_M042	ang	You're not going like this.
Ses04F_script03_2_F041	ang	finally and forever
Ses04F_script03_2_F042	ang	Oh, I am.  Let go of me.
Ses04F_script03_2_M043	ang	You're not.
Ses04F_script03_2_F043	ang	Oh, I hate you. It's a good thing that I found out in time what you're really like. Marry you again?  Never, never, never.
Ses04F_script03_2_M044	ang	Shut up.  Shut up. I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on your bended knees.
Ses04F_script03_2_M045	ang	You're a mean, evil minded, little tempered witch. I hope to God I never set eyes on you again as long as I live. Whore.
Ses04F_script03_2_F044	ang	I'd rather die in torment. Beast.  Brute.  Calf swine.
Ses04M_impro01_M000	neu	Yeah, hi.  Um, look, I -- all I'm trying to do right now is renew my license plate.  That's all.  I just need to get one of those little stickers.
Ses04M_impro01_F000	neu	Okay.  What's the problem?
Ses04M_impro01_M001	fru	And I've- I've- some lady -- I got in line.  I waited for about two hours um, and, I gave her this form
Ses04M_impro01_M002	fru	that she gave to me earlier. And she said oh, I gave you the wrong one by accident.  So I was hoping I could just fill out a new one, give it to you and sort of skip this whole line business.
Ses04M_impro01_F001	neu	Okay, um.  Do you have your photo ID with you?
Ses04M_impro01_M003	neu	Yes, I do.
Ses04M_impro01_F002	neu	Okay.  This is the wrong form.  I'm sorry.
Ses04M_impro01_M004	fru	This is -- okay, then just can I have the form that I need.
Ses04M_impro01_F003	fru	I don't have the form.  You're going to have to go get in that line over there and they will give you the right form.  And after you fill it out, you can bring it back to me.
Ses04M_impro01_M005	fru	Don't you -- you don't have-
Ses04M_impro01_M006	fru	are you telling me you don't have a stack of them behind the desk?
Ses04M_impro01_F004	fru	I don't have any of
Ses04M_impro01_F005	fru	I don't have any of them over here.  You're gonna have to go get in that line over there.  And they will give you a copy of the form.
Ses04M_impro01_M007	fru	But you're -- it's the same -- I mean, you can -- like I can't go behind your desk--
Ses04M_impro01_F006	fru	Nope, I don't. I don't have-
Ses04M_impro01_M008	fru	or I can't go behind there- you can go behind this person's desk and just grab the form. So if you could just do that; that would help me out a lot.
Ses04M_impro01_F007	fru	No, I can't. That's-
Ses04M_impro01_F008	fru	I'm sorry.  You have to do things the way you have to do things here.  We have rules.
Ses04M_impro01_M009	fru	Look, can you please just-- --make this -- look, I look--

Ses04M_impro01_M010	fru	look-- It's  been- it's been two hours.  Can you please just make this easier on me and just go and get the form?  It's not- it's really not
Ses04M_impro01_F010	fru	I'm sorry.  I'm sorry you're having a hard time,
Ses04M_impro01_F011	fru	but you're gonna have to go get in  that line to
Ses04M_impro01_M011	fru	What if I pay you money?
Ses04M_impro01_M012	fru	Can I pay you money?  Can I give you, like, twenty bucks and you'll go back there and get the form?
Ses04M_impro01_F012	neu	twenty bucks? Please. Go get in that line over there.
Ses04M_impro01_M013	fru	Come on.  Will you please?  I just --I look, I  cannot-- --just if I --
Ses04M_impro01_F013	fru	Look, I'm having a really bad day.  I'm off in twenty minutes and I just really don't need this right now, okay.
Ses04M_impro01_M014	fru	I don't care, well- You're having a bad -- I just waited in line for two hours.
Ses04M_impro01_F014	fru	And you're gonna have to go wait again, because that's the line you need.
Ses04M_impro01_F015	fru	I can't do that. It's against our rules. You can go get in that line over there or you can just go ahead and leave and come back another day.  Maybe there will be a shorter line.
Ses04M_impro01_M016	fru	That's all I- I just- That's all i want you to-
Ses04M_impro01_M017	fru	Rules, you just have to grab a piece of paper behind from somebody's desk
Ses04M_impro01_M018	ang	It's not rocket science.
Ses04M_impro01_M019	fru	Come -- just, please, just grab the form.  It's right over there.
Ses04M_impro01_F016	fru	I can't do that.
Ses04M_impro01_M021	fru	Why are you being such a bitch?
Ses04M_impro01_F017	fru	I'm sorry, but I can't do that.
Ses04M_impro01_M022	fru	Please, will you please -- will you please just grab the form?
Ses04M_impro01_F018	ang	So go get in the other line or leave.  Or I will have you escorted out by security.
Ses04M_impro01_F019	ang	Would you like to be kicked out of the D.M.V.?  You don't think that'll be a little embarrassing?
Ses04M_impro01_M023	fru	Fine, which line is it?
Ses04M_impro01_F020	fru	The one you just came from.
Ses04M_impro01_M024	ang	Okay, fine.  I'll go over there.  Thanks, a lot.  You've been really helpful.
Ses04M_impro01_F021	ang	Yeah.  Thank you.  Have a pleasant day.
Ses04M_impro02_M000	sad	It's only going to be a year.
Ses04M_impro02_M002	fru	There's nothing I --
Ses04M_impro02_F002	fru	You're just going to pick up and leave me and our baby and miss a year of our lives?
Ses04M_impro02_M003	fru	It's -- look, it's only a year.  It'll go by quickly.  Okay.
Ses04M_impro02_M004	fru	I know, but I'll be back then.  And - and- and we'll have -- we have the rest of our lives.
Ses04M_impro02_M005	fru	I can't do that.  I have to go.
Ses04M_impro02_F005	fru	Do you want to -- do you want to leave us behind?  I mean, I don't understand why you have to do this.
Ses04M_impro02_M006	fru	I've made a pledge.  I can't not do this at this point.
Ses04M_impro02_M007	fru	I know that. I know that. I know that.
Ses04M_impro02_M008	neu	There's nothing I can do.  I mean, I have to go.
Ses04M_impro02_M009	fru	And this is what I do.  This is -- I mean, this is my life.  And I know that you're part of my life, too, and I mean, it's only -- it's just going to be a year.  I'll be back.
Ses04M_impro02_F007	fru	Can't you ask them?  Can't you go back and ask them if you could -- I don't know if you could change  assignments or something and you could stay here?
Ses04M_impro02_M010	fru	It's not- it's not- It's not like that.  It's not like that.  I can't do that.
Ses04M_impro02_F008	fru	Why not?  You could, at least, try.  They have to understand
Ses04M_impro02_M011	fru	Because it's impossible.  There's -- I just can't.  I can't.
Ses04M_impro02_F009	sad	You won't even know your child when you come back.  This -- isn't there someone you could talk to?
Ses04M_impro02_F010	fru	Explain the situation to them and then you can stay here.
Ses04M_impro02_M012	fru	Look, honey, it's- it's- it's only going to be a year.
Ses04M_impro02_M013	fru	It's only going to be a year. I'm not going to miss my son's entire life.
Ses04M_impro02_F011	fru	And what happens if, at the end of that year, they ask you to stay longer?  Are you just going to agree?  Are you just going to absentmindedly brainwashedly do whatever it is they tell you to do?
Ses04M_impro02_M014	fru	I'm not going to stay more than a year.  I've  agreed to a year
Ses04M_impro02_F012	fru	Then why do you have to go a year at all?
Ses04M_impro02_M015	fru	Because I've already agreed to that.
Ses04M_impro02_F013	fru	Well unagree.  Tell them that you can't leave right now.  I can't do this by myself.  I can't do this without you.
Ses04M_impro02_M016	fru	Yes, you can.  Yes, you can.  You know you can.  You're a strong person.
Ses04M_impro02_M017	fru	It is. It is. It is. It is. I'm going to write you every day.
Ses04M_impro02_M018	fru	What else can we do?  I -- we don't have a choice in this.  Do you understand?  You can't come with me and I can't stay here.  That's all there is to it.
Ses04M_impro02_F016	fru	There has to be something.  I mean, we can't just live with this.  It's not -- it just won't work this way.
Ses04M_impro02_M019	fru	We don't have a choice.  I have to do this.
Ses04M_impro02_F017	fru	Just tell them no.
Ses04M_impro02_M020	fru	I can't do it.  I'd love to.  I mean, I don't - if you understand, I don't want to stay.
Ses04M_impro02_M021	fru	I mean, I don't want to -- I don't want to leave.  I want to stay here with you.
Ses04M_impro02_F018	fru	Then, can't you please try something?  If you go and ask them and they say no, then I would understand, but you're not even willing to ask.
Ses04M_impro02_F019	fru	Can't you just make an effort?  Can't you just try?
Ses04M_impro02_M022	fru	I've asked already.  I can't go back.
Ses04M_impro02_M023	fru	It can't happen.  I have to go.  I want to stay really bad, but I can't.  There's just no -- I don't have an option.
Ses04M_impro02_F020	sad	When do you leave?
Ses04M_impro02_M024	fru	Next week.
Ses04M_impro02_F021	ang	A week.  You're giving me a week to be okay with this.
Ses04M_impro02_M025	fru	You can't make it out like I'm happy about this.  I mean, I didn't -- I didn't want to put you in this situation.
Ses04M_impro02_F022	fru	Well it doesn't seem like you're that bothered by it.
Ses04M_impro02_M026	fru	I am.  I mean, I don't know.  I don't know what else to tell -- you know, I mean, I can tell you.  I don't know what else to do. I mean, I've been forced into this situation.
Ses04M_impro02_F023	fru	If you really cared so much, you'd find a way out.
Ses04M_impro02_M027	fru	There's nothing I can do.  I-- I
Ses04M_impro02_M028	fru	They won't let you come along.  It's not going to happen.
Ses04M_impro02_F025	fru	It's a free world.  I can go where I want.  Wherever you are, that's where we're going to go.
Ses04M_impro02_M029	fru	Are you kidding? Please don't be difficult about this.
Ses04M_impro02_M030	fru	[BREATHING]
Ses04M_impro02_F027	fru	I'm finding a way to make it work.  And I will go wherever you go.  Whatever I have to do, I will make this work.
Ses04M_impro02_M031	fru	Look, I--
Ses04M_impro02_F028	fru	You're not really giving me a lot of options.
Ses04M_impro02_M032	fru	Where I'm going is not the safest place on the earth.  Okay.
Ses04M_impro02_F029	fru	But I'm supposed to be okay with you going there.
Ses04M_impro02_M033	fru	But I've been trained.  You have no training.
Ses04M_impro02_M034	fru	You have to.  Do you understand me?  You have to.
Ses04M_impro02_M035	fru	Well I guess we're at a stalemate then, aren't we?
Ses04M_impro03_M002	exc	Yeah, it's pretty amazing, huh?
Ses04M_impro03_F002	exc	I can't -- how did you do it?  What happened?
Ses04M_impro03_F003	exc	[LAUGHTER] Well you paint a romantic picture.
Ses04M_impro03_M005	hap	Well I didn't want it to be like cheesy, you know.
Ses04M_impro03_F004	exc	Did she cry?
Ses04M_impro03_M006	hap	She didn't cry, but she was laughing a lot and it was very exciting, so...
Ses04M_impro03_F005	exc	Oh, my God.  How long have you been planning on doing this?
Ses04M_impro03_M007	hap	Honestly, it was kind of quickly.  It was actually only in the past couple months.
Ses04M_impro03_F006	exc	I can't believe this.  You're getting married. It's crazy!
Ses04M_impro03_M008	hap	Yeah. Yeah. So- I know.  I know. I know.  It's weird 'cause it's like the beginning of the rest of my life, you know.
Ses04M_impro03_F007	exc	Yeah, it is.
Ses04M_impro03_M009	hap	But uh- no, I mean, you know.  You know, I really want you to like, you know, sort of
Ses04M_impro03_F008	exc	Yeah, I would love to. Thanks. [LAUGHTER]
Ses04M_impro03_M011	exc	Okay. Well there you go.
Ses04M_impro03_F009	exc	Oh, my God, where -- have you guys talked about where you're going to get married or--
Ses04M_impro03_F010	exc	Oh, my God.
Ses04M_impro03_F011	exc	Are you going to get married like on the beach barefoot or like fancier?  Like in a church.
Ses04M_impro03_M015	exc	Barefoot?
Ses04M_impro03_F012	exc	Well I don't know.  Throwing it out there.
Ses04M_impro03_M017	exc	Yeah.  But I'm really excited.  So and everybody's going to come out and it'll be a great time.  And--
Ses04M_impro03_F015	exc	It's so exciting.  What's the ring look like?
Ses04M_impro03_M019	exc	It's big and shiny.  I don't know.  It's silver and--
Ses04M_impro03_F016	exc	Big and shiny.  You're such a guy. [LAUGHTER]
Ses04M_impro03_M020	hap	Yeah, I don't know. [LAUGHTER] But, yeah, so anyway -- well I wanted to tell you that, you know, 'cause you're one of my good friends and you're Kate's- one of her best friends and-

Ses04M_impro03_M021	hap	Yeah, yeah. She was actually -- she was going to tell you but I told her that I wanted to tell you and she had to work today anyway, so I decided to-
Ses04M_impro03_M022	hap	Yeah, yeah.
Ses04M_impro03_F019	exc	It's fantastic.  I -- congratulations. It's amazing.
Ses04M_impro03_M023	exc	Thank you.  I'm really -- I'm really excited.  And it's -- I don't know, it's like a little -- it's like a little scary, 'cause I'm like, ah, you know, it's the first time I've ever done anything like this.
Ses04M_impro03_M024	hap	But, you know, it's like I really love her and I really just -- I can't imagine spending my life with anybody else but her.  So, you know, it's like I know that's the right thing.  And if you have to, you know, if you have to question that, you know, don't- don't do it.  So we're going to do it.
Ses04M_impro03_M025	hap	And it's going to -- the -- you know, I told her that I just -- I want the color brown to be as an integral in the wedding.  And, um, maybe some greens and blues.
Ses04M_impro03_M026	hap	She's okay with it.
Ses04M_impro03_M028	hap	Well, I mean I just told her--Well I just said, you know, hey, these are my suggestions.
Ses04M_impro03_M029	hap	All fruit and the color brown. Just that. That's all- that's my only request.
Ses04M_impro03_F024	hap	This is why men don't plan weddings. [LAUGHTER]
Ses04M_impro03_M030	hap	Yeah.  Well maybe--maybe you're right. Maybe there's something to that.
Ses04M_impro03_F025	exc	All fruit and brown. [LAUGHTER]
Ses04M_impro03_M031	neu	So, um, anyway, do you want to order now?   So, um I mean--
Ses04M_impro04_M000	fru	Oh, man, I just -- I don't know what to do.  I don't know what to do.  It's like every job, you know, I go to; every job I apply to,
Ses04M_impro04_M001	fru	it's just like nobody- nobody wants to hire me. It's been years, I mean, do you understand, years?  Like, I'm -- you know what I mean, it's like I've been collecting unemployment for so long now, it's just like I just -- I can't take it.  I don't know what to do.  I mean, I'm just like losing my mind.
Ses04M_impro04_F000	neu	Well there has to be something you haven't tried.
Ses04M_impro04_M002	fru	I-I'm not kidding.  I've tried everything.  Like I've gone to every business and local, you know,
Ses04M_impro04_M003	fru	local business in- in the area and I can't- I can't get anything.  Like, nobody -
Ses04M_impro04_F001	neu	What about like a temp agency?
Ses04M_impro04_F002	neu	Have you gone, like, signed up with a temp agency?  Maybe they can help.
Ses04M_impro04_M004	neu	there's just like no jobs available.  I mean, it's just like, God.
Ses04M_impro04_M005	fru	Yeah, I tried that.  And there was like, yeah, like I did like one thing once.  But, like, that's not -- it doesn't last very long.  And it's not enough to live on.
Ses04M_impro04_F003	neu	Right, but you have -- I mean, you have to keep on them.  You have to keep calling and reminding them that you're still looking and
Ses04M_impro04_F004	neu	I mean, you have to be really aggressive about it.
Ses04M_impro04_M006	fru	Yeah, I do.  I do.  You don't understand.
Ses04M_impro04_M007	fru	I- You don't understand. I don't have a job.  All- My job is to look for a job.  I don't do anything else.
Ses04M_impro04_M008	fru	But, like, it's been years now and I just can't seem to get anything that really fits.  It's just it -- I -- it drives me absolutely insane.
Ses04M_impro04_F005	neu	Well, I mean, if it's that bad, maybe you're gonna have to take something that doesn't really fit, you know.  Like maybe you'll have to do something else for a while.  Find a new field, new skill.
Ses04M_impro04_M009	fru	No, no, no, no, no.  I can't- I can't do that.  I can't, I- because if I'm not- if I'm not- if I'm not doing something that I love, then I can't -- I can't- I mean it's- what's the point?
Ses04M_impro04_F006	neu	Well then you're choosing to be unemployed, really.
Ses04M_impro04_M010	fru	I'm not choosing. I'm not-
Ses04M_impro04_F007	neu	If you're not willing to try and work with it and find something and, you know, I mean, there are things you could do.
Ses04M_impro04_M011	fru	No, but I'm try- but like all the things that I-it's like I apply to all these places and none of them
Ses04M_impro04_M012	fru	-- I mean, I don't understand.  It's like -- I mean, I feel like I'm qualified enough.  I just don't understand.  Like, I mean, it's just like a matter of circumstance, but it's been three years, you know, three years.
Ses04M_impro04_F008	neu	Well maybe, you know, your luck it is just down and the market for your particular field is down and maybe you just need to look into doing something else for a while.
Ses04M_impro04_M013	fru	This is stupid.
Ses04M_impro04_F009	neu	I mean, I'm not saying that you should, you know--
Ses04M_impro04_M014	fru	You know what, this is your fault.
Ses04M_impro04_M015	fru	It's your fault 'cause -cause you always told me to- to do this and I did that instead.  And I didn't take your advice and - and- but you sort of were like were telling--
Ses04M_impro04_F011	neu	It's my fault 'cause you didn't do what I told you to?
Ses04M_impro04_M016	fru	Yeah, exactly.
Ses04M_impro04_F012	neu	Well that sounds like your fault.
Ses04M_impro04_M017	fru	Yeah.
Ses04M_impro04_F013	neu	You didn't do what I told you to do.
Ses04M_impro04_M018	fru	That's 'cause you always tell me to do the wrong thing.  And I thought this time it was -- I was gonna be right by going with the opposite thing. So it's your fault because
Ses04M_impro04_M019	fru	-because you were always wrong and-and-and this time you were right. And-and I didn't -- yeah, that's why.
Ses04M_impro04_M020	neu	Well, I mean, it makes sense, doesn't it, hmm?
Ses04M_impro04_F015	neu	I think maybe you can't get employed because you aren't willing to take responsibility for your own actions.
Ses04M_impro04_M021	neu	That's not true.  I take responsibility for my own actions.
Ses04M_impro04_F016	neu	Really?  Whose fault is it you don't have a job?
Ses04M_impro04_M022	neu	Yours.  I don't--
Ses04M_impro04_F017	neu	[LAUGHTER]
Ses04M_impro05_M000	fru	Yeah, hi.  Look--Um, okay.  Here's the thing.
Ses04M_impro05_F000	neu	Hi, how can I help you?
Ses04M_impro05_F001	neu	Mmhmm.
Ses04M_impro05_M002	fru	lost my luggage. Your airline--
Ses04M_impro05_F002	neu	I'm sorry.
Ses04M_impro05_F003	neu	Right.
Ses04M_impro05_M003	fru	lost my luggage. I didn't lose it. No, it's not like I left it somewhere and somebody took it.
Ses04M_impro05_M004	fru	It was lost.  I waited on the conveyor -- near the conveyor belt to see, you know, where -- then the baggage claim and see if it would- it would come out.
Ses04M_impro05_M005	fru	Didn't come out.  I spoke to somebody, a local authority figure.
Ses04M_impro05_M006	fru	And he told me to come to this desk here so I can, uh, at least get, uh, the hundred- hundred and fifty dollars that- that I'm owed for my loss.
Ses04M_impro05_M007	fru	'Cause that's roughly how much the bag plus all its contents was worth.
Ses04M_impro05_F006	neu	Uh. Okay.  I -- first of all, I'm very sorry you lost your bag.
Ses04M_impro05_F007	neu	Um, but, actually, our policy is a fifty dollar
Ses04M_impro05_M008	ang	fifty dollars?
Ses04M_impro05_F008	neu	refund--coverage of the bag that was lost. yes
Ses04M_impro05_M009	ang	fifty dollars. No way, no.
Ses04M_impro05_F009	neu	That's our policy, sir.
Ses04M_impro05_M010	ang	I don't but the thing is, I don't care about your policy.
Ses04M_impro05_M011	ang	You understand?
Ses04M_impro05_M012	fru	What I want you to do is I want you to write three of those, as if I were three people.  Okay.  You can write -- you can just put my name on all --
Ses04M_impro05_F010	neu	I can't do that.
Ses04M_impro05_M013	fru	But what I'm telling you is that's what you're going to do.

Ses04M_impro05_F014	fru	We only cover fifty do-
Ses04M_impro05_M018	ang	Just -- you can fill out the form--We can fill out - no, no, no, we can fill out the form three times.
Ses04M_impro05_F015	fru	We only cover fifty dollars worth of lost items.
Ses04M_impro05_M019	fru	And then that'll be that. It's going to be fine. Just-
Ses04M_impro05_F016	fru	I'm very sorry.
Ses04M_impro05_F017	neu	I'm very sorry.  I understand you're upset.  You just got off a long flight.
Ses04M_impro05_M021	fru	You don't understand. You don't understand, actually.  You don't understand because it was my luggage that was lost.  Okay.
Ses04M_impro05_F018	fru	We really -- we want to work with you. We really -- we want to help.
Ses04M_impro05_F019	neu	I understand that.  I would know if it was mine. Um-
Ses04M_impro05_M022	ang	Yeah.  If it was yours, but it's not. It's mine.  Okay. So just--
Ses04M_impro05_F020	neu	But it's not.  It's yours.  I understand.
Ses04M_impro05_F021	fru	I know.  We want to work with you.  We will give you the fifty dollars but I'm--

Ses04M_impro05_F023	fru	We will definitely keep an eye out for your bag. We will try to find it.  We will, you know, fill out the form for missing items.
Ses04M_impro05_M025	fru	Look, can I just -- can I speak to your manager, please?  'Cause I- I really -- I don't, um -- I mean, I just don't want to deal with -- I know that -- I mean, I know this isn't your fault,
Ses04M_impro05_F024	fru	No one can make the three check thing happen 'cause we don't do that.
Ses04M_impro05_F025	fru	I can write you the one check.
Ses04M_impro05_M026	ang	but I need to speak to somebody who can make the three check thing happen.
Ses04M_impro05_F026	fru	All- all that my supervisor could do is the exact same thing that I'm offering to do.
Ses04M_impro05_M027	fru	But what I'm talk -- but I'm just,just- please let me--
Ses04M_impro05_M028	fru	But if I could just speak directly -- if I could just speak directly to your-- to your superior person
Ses04M_impro05_F027	fru	I'd be happy to give you a cup of coffee, too.
Ses04M_impro05_F028	fru	We'll just throw that in--gratuitously.
Ses04M_impro05_M029	fru	then that would be helpful to me because I just feel like if- you don't think you have the power to write three checks but you actually do. see?
Ses04M_impro05_F029	fru	No, I don't. See, I could lose my job if I did that.
Ses04M_impro05_M030	fru	But your job is not my concern. My concern is getting my luggage.
Ses04M_impro05_F030	fru	And your bag is not my concern.
Ses04M_impro05_F031	fru	The fifty dollars I'm going to give you for your bag is really all I'm concerned with.
Ses04M_impro05_M031	fru	Look, I don't -- look, can we just not argue about this.  Like--
Ses04M_impro05_F032	fru	I'm more than happy to not argue about it.  I will give you your fifty dollar certificate.
Ses04M_impro05_F033	fru	You can go ahead and go fill out the form. We'll look for your bag.
Ses04M_impro05_M032	fru	So what if- what if we- what if we do three forms
Ses04M_impro05_M033	fru	with different names on them? That-
Ses04M_impro05_F034	fru	Then that would be lying.
Ses04M_impro05_M034	fru	but, no. See, 'cause
Ses04M_impro05_M035	fru	if we have three forms then I can get the hundred and fifty.
Ses04M_impro05_F035	fru	I'm sorry.  We can only issue one fifty dollar certificate to cover the lost bag for one person.
Ses04M_impro05_M036	fru	Just please, will you please just work with me here? Just -- all I'm asking you to do is just work with me. I know -- I know that you get lots of people all day long who give you shit, give you crap, but
Ses04M_impro05_F036	neu	I understand you're frustrated, but--
Ses04M_impro05_M037	fru	um, you know, I -- this is my bag and I need the hundred and fifty dollars. Please.

Ses04M_impro05_M039	ang	I'm already calm. Okay, I'm calm. I'm calm.
Ses04M_impro05_M040	fru	Just all I need you to do is just fill out three forms and I'll leave you alone forever, forever.  I'll never -- we'll never see each other again.
Ses04M_impro05_F039	fru	And I'm looking forward to that.  However, I can't do that. I would lose my job.
Ses04M_impro05_M041	fru	But that's not going to-- But you don't understand. You're looking forward to never seeing me again.
Ses04M_impro05_F040	fru	Oh, yes.
Ses04M_impro05_M042	fru	But never seeing me again is not going to happen until you give me the three checks.
Ses04M_impro05_F041	fru	I'm sorry, really.  But--
Ses04M_impro05_M043	fru	I don't -- I'm not- I'm not convinced.
Ses04M_impro05_F042	fru	That I'm sorry?
Ses04M_impro05_M044	ang	Yeah.  If you were really sorry, you'd give me the three checks.
Ses04M_impro05_M045	ang	So why don't we just do that and stop this nonsense, hmm?  Hmm?
Ses04M_impro06_F000	sad	Hey, how you doing?
Ses04M_impro06_F001	sad	I'm sorry.
Ses04M_impro06_M000	sad	Thanks.
Ses04M_impro06_F002	sad	I know- I know there's nothing I can say that will really help, but--
Ses04M_impro06_M001	sad	I know.  I just -- I don't know.  It's just weird because you have somebody who's, you know,
Ses04M_impro06_M002	sad	a major part of your life and then they're gone.  And I don't know.  That's not really -- it's never really happened to me before.
Ses04M_impro06_F003	sad	I'm sorry.  It's never easy.
Ses04M_impro06_M003	sad	Yeah.
Ses04M_impro06_F004	sad	But, I'm here if there's anything you need.  I mean, you just have to ask.  I know --
Ses04M_impro06_M004	sad	Thanks.
Ses04M_impro06_F005	sad	--it doesn't really do anything.  But--
Ses04M_impro06_M005	sad	I just -- it's just not fair.
Ses04M_impro06_F006	sad	I know.  It never is.
Ses04M_impro06_F007	sad	How's, um -- how's his parents doing?
Ses04M_impro06_M006	sad	I mean, they're, you know, they're upset.  It's like you know, they
Ses04M_impro06_M007	sad	feel the same way everybody else does.
Ses04M_impro06_F008	sad	I mean, what do you want to do?  Do you want to- do you want to talk about it?  Do you-
Ses04M_impro06_M008	sad	[BREATHING] I mean, there's nothing really to talk about.  He's gone and I'll never see him again.
Ses04M_impro06_F009	sad	Well I know it's not a lot of help or anything, but at least you got to know him.  I mean, at least you had the time with him that you did.
Ses04M_impro06_M009	sad	Yeah.
Ses04M_impro06_F010	sad	I mean, we can be grateful for that.
Ses04M_impro06_M010	sad	Yeah, I don't know.  Sometimes I wish I didn't know him.  So I wouldn't--
Ses04M_impro06_F011	sad	You feel that way now because you're upset.  But you don't really think that.
Ses04M_impro06_F012	sad	It'll get better.  I know it doesn't help, but it will get better and you will remember all of the good things that you guys had; all of the memories that you have with him that were happy and you'll be grateful for those.
Ses04M_impro06_M011	sad	This is just -- this is a terrible life.  I just don't understand.
Ses04M_impro06_M012	sad	I mean, it's just not fair.  Like, I don't know.  Why people -
Ses04M_impro06_M013	sad	there should just be some sort of rule that people don't die until they're older, 'cause then, at least, it's expected.
Ses04M_impro06_F014	sad	I agree.  If I knew how to make that happen, I would certainly help you.
Ses04M_impro06_M014	sad	I don't know what to do.
Ses04M_impro06_F015	sad	When's the service? Can- can we help?  Is there anything, I mean--
Ses04M_impro06_M015	sad	I mean, you- you can go.  I don't know.  I don't know what else.
Ses04M_impro06_M016	sad	I hope it rains.  Somehow that'll make me feel more comfortable.
Ses04M_impro06_F016	sad	Seems like if the whole world's sad, then it's okay for you to be.
Ses04M_impro06_M017	sad	Yeah.
Ses04M_impro06_M018	sad	I just wish there was some way to just bring him back to life magically.
Ses04M_impro06_F017	sad	I know.
Ses04M_impro06_M019	sad	Just, you know, some thing; some genie. I need to find a genie bottle.
Ses04M_impro06_F018	sad	I don't have any magic answers.  But,
Ses04M_impro06_F019	sad	I mean, as- as cliche as it is, as long as people who loved him remember him, then it's not a waste, you know.
Ses04M_impro06_M020	sad	I know.
Ses04M_impro07_M000	exc	Alright, so you're not going to believe this.  But I went home today. I looked through the mail.  And I got an acceptance letter from U.S.C..

Ses04M_script01_1_M019	fru	You know it's not only my business.
Ses04M_script01_1_F018	ang	What do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind.
Ses04M_script01_1_F019	neu	Well you want to make sure your father isn't going to have --
Ses04M_script01_1_M021	ang	Well, then you know it's not only my business.
Ses04M_script01_1_F020	fru	I'm just saying.
Ses04M_script01_1_M022	ang	Sometimes you infuriate me, you know that?  Isn't it your business, too, if I tell this to father and he throws a fit about it?  You have such a talent for ignoring things.
Ses04M_script01_1_F021	ang	I ignore what I got to ignore.  The girl is Larry's girl.
Ses04M_script01_1_M023	fru	She's not Larry's girl.
Ses04M_script01_1_F022	ang	From father's point of view, he's not dead.  And you have no right to take his girl.
Ses04M_script01_1_F023	fru	Now you can go on from there if you know where to go. But I'm telling you I don't know where to go.  See, I don't know.
Ses04M_script01_1_F024	fru	Now what can I do for you?
Ses04M_script01_1_M024	fru	I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something I want, I have to pull back because other people will suffer.  My whole bloody life, time after time after time.
Ses04M_script01_1_M025	fru	To hell with that.
Ses04M_script01_1_M026	neu	I wanted to get this settled first.
Ses04M_script01_1_F027	neu	How do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way father does.
Ses04M_script01_1_F028	neu	The trouble is, you don't see enough women.  You never did.
Ses04M_script01_1_F029	ang	I don't see why it has to be Annie.
Ses04M_script01_1_M029	fru	Because it is.
Ses04M_script01_1_M030	fru	Line?
Ses04M_script01_1_F031	fru	Alright, then, mom.
Ses04M_script01_1_M031	neu	Alright, then, mom.  Did we skip something?  No.  Alright, then, mom.
Ses04M_script01_1_F032	neu	Yes we did. Do you want to keep going?
Ses04M_script01_1_M032	neu	Yeah, let's keep going.
Ses04M_script01_1_F033	neu	Just give it some more thought.
Ses04M_script01_1_M033	fru	I've given it three years' of thought.  I'd hope that if
Ses04M_script01_1_M034	sad	father forgot about Larry, we'd have a regular wedding and everything happy.  If I can't get that here, then I'll have to get out.
Ses04M_script01_1_F034	ang	What the hell is this?
Ses04M_script01_1_F035	ang	Are you crazy?
Ses04M_script01_1_M036	fru	I've been a good son too long; a good sucker.  I'm through with it.
Ses04M_script01_1_F036	ang	You've got a business here.  What the hell is this?
Ses04M_script01_1_M037	ang	The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.
Ses04M_script01_1_F037	ang	Must you be inspired?
Ses04M_script01_1_M038	ang	Yes.  I like getting an hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, at least at evening, I want it beautiful.
Ses04M_script01_1_M040	neu	Yes, on this I would.
Ses04M_script01_1_F039	ang	You don't want to think like that.
Ses04M_script01_1_M041	neu	Then you help me stay here.
Ses04M_script01_1_F040	ang	Alright.  But just don't think like that because what the hell did we work for?  That's all for you, Chris.  The whole shooting match is just for you.
Ses04M_script01_1_M042	fru	I know that.  Just you help me stay here.
Ses04M_script01_1_F041	ang	But don't think that way, you hear me?
Ses04M_script01_1_M044	fru	No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.
Ses04M_script01_2_F000	ang	Why did he invite her here?
Ses04M_script01_2_M000	neu	Oh, God, line.
Ses04M_script01_2_F001	neu	Why does that bother you?
Ses04M_script01_2_F002	ang	She's been in New York three and a half years.  Why, all of a sudden--
Ses04M_script01_2_F003	ang	Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.
Ses04M_script01_2_M003	fru	What do you mean?  He grew up next door to the girl all his life.  Why shouldn't he want to -- why shouldn't he want to see her again?
Ses04M_script01_2_F004	ang	He's not going to marry her.
Ses04M_script01_2_M005	neu	How do you know he's even thinking about it?
Ses04M_script01_2_F005	ang	It's got that about it.
Ses04M_script01_2_M006	neu	Well so what?
Ses04M_script01_2_F006	ang	What's going on here, Joe?
Ses04M_script01_2_M007	neu	Line.
Ses04M_script01_2_F007	neu	Now listen, kid. Now, listen.
Ses04M_script01_2_F008	ang	She's not his girl, Joe.  She knows she's not.
Ses04M_script01_2_F009	ang	Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men.  Why hasn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she's waited.
Ses04M_script01_2_F010	ang	Because she knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my worst moments, I think of her waiting and I know, again, that I'm right.
Ses04M_script01_2_M011	fru	Look, it's a nice day.  What are we arguing for?
Ses04M_script01_2_F011	ang	Nobody in this house dares take her faith away, Joe.  Strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.
Ses04M_script01_2_M012	fru	What do you want me to do? What do you want?
Ses04M_script01_2_F012	ang	I want you to act like he's coming back, both of you.  Don't think I haven't noticed you since he invited her here.  I won't stand for any nonsense.
Ses04M_script01_2_M013	fru	But, Kate--
Ses04M_script01_2_F013	ang	Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.
Ses04M_script01_2_F014	ang	Laugh.  Laugh at me.  But why did that happen the very night that she came here?
Ses04M_script01_2_F015	ang	She goes to sleep in his bed and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look.  Look at it.  Joe--
Ses04M_script01_2_M014	fru	Calm yourself.
Ses04M_script01_2_F016	ang	Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand all alone
Ses04M_script01_2_M015	fru	Calm yourself.
Ses04M_script01_2_M016	fru	Alright, alright.  Calm yourself.
Ses04M_script01_2_F018	ang	You, above all, have got to believe.  You.
Ses04M_script01_2_M017	fru	Why me above all?
Ses04M_script01_2_F020	sad	I can't help it.
Ses04M_script01_2_M019	ang	What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?
Ses04M_script01_3_F012	hap	Every day since.
Ses04M_script01_3_F013	hap	I was waiting for you, Chris.  'Til then, you never wrote and when you did, what did you say?  You sure can be ambiguous, you know.
Ses04M_script01_3_F014	hap	I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I've done is sit around and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.
Ses04M_script01_3_M022	sad	Yes, I suppose there has been.  But it's going from me.
Ses04M_script01_3_M023	sad	I don't know where to start.
Ses04M_script01_3_M024	sad	It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in command of a company?
Ses04M_script01_3_M025	sad	Well I lost them.
Ses04M_script01_3_F022	sad	How many?
Ses04M_script01_3_M026	sad	Just about all.
Ses04M_script01_3_F023	sad	Oh, gees.
Ses04M_script01_3_M027	sad	It takes a little time to toss that off because they weren't just men.
Ses04M_script01_3_M028	sad	For instance, one time it'd been raining several days.  And this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks; put them in my pocket.  That's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had.
Ses04M_script01_3_M030	sad	And I got this idea watching them go down, everything was being destroyed, see?  But, to me, it seemed there was one new thing that was made,
Ses04M_script01_3_M031	sad	a kind of responsibility.  Man for man.  You understand me?  And then I went home and it was incredible.
Ses04M_script01_3_M032	sad	There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them was some sort of bus accident.  Then I went to work for dad and that whole rat race again.  I felt, what you said, ashamed somehow
Ses04M_script01_3_M033	sad	because nobody was changed.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive;
Ses04M_script01_3_M034	sad	to open that bank book; to drive the new car; to see the new refrigerator.  I mean, you can take these things out of a war, but when you drive the new car, you have to know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.
Ses04M_script01_3_M035	sad	You have to be a little better because of that.  Otherwise, we have is really loot and there's blood on it.  I don't want to take any of it.  I guess that included you.
Ses04M_script01_3_M037	hap	Annie, Annie, I'm going to make you a fortune.
Ses04M_script01_3_F027	hap	What'll I do with a fortune?
Ses04M_script02_1_M001	exc	Actually, I wanted to go a little farther up the coast, get away from the lights and the people, but I was afraid we'd miss it.  How you doing?
Ses04M_script02_1_F000	neu	Fine.
Ses04M_script02_1_M002	exc	Is that, is that - is that just foam?  I can't even tell.  Although, if you can't tell, it's probably isn't them.  It'll probably be unmistakable, don't you think?
Ses04M_script02_1_M003	exc	How you doing?  Oh, no, you know what I did?  I forgot to bring my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I should have brought my flashlight.
Ses04M_script02_1_F002	ang	It's not yours.
Ses04M_script02_1_M005	neu	Whose is it?
Ses04M_script02_1_F003	ang	It's ours.  It's mine, too.
Ses04M_script02_1_M006	fru	Well, sure.
Ses04M_script02_1_F004	ang	You kept saying my flashlight as if it's somehow just yours.  How is that supposed to make me feel?
Ses04M_script02_1_M008	exc	I wonder, do they always run during a full moon? I can't remember if it was full last year.  Remember?
Ses04M_script02_1_F005	ang	Yes.
Ses04M_script02_1_M009	neu	Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  We should have brought the blanket, our blanket.
Ses04M_script02_1_M012	neu	You want my jacket?
Ses04M_script02_1_F007	ang	It's after eleven; let's go home.
Ses04M_script02_1_M013	fru	Are you kidding?  We'd miss it.  We just got here.  What's the point of coming down here if we just turn around and go home?
Ses04M_script02_1_F008	ang	There is no point in coming down here.
Ses04M_script02_1_M014	neu	Right.
Ses04M_script02_1_F009	fru	That's my point.
Ses04M_script02_1_M015	neu	That's my point, too.
Ses04M_script02_1_F010	ang	So let's go home.
Ses04M_script02_1_M016	fru	No, no, no.  That's not my point.  My point is is that there's no point in coming down here if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it?
Ses04M_script02_1_F011	fru	Not particularly.
Ses04M_script02_1_F012	ang	I just don't.  It's stupid.
Ses04M_script02_1_M018	exc	Honey, this is a natural phenomenon.  I mean, this only happens once a year.  It's a great opportunity.  Think about the people in Kansas.  They'd have to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to come see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up.
Ses04M_script02_1_F013	ang	Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, flop around and then they swim away.  And then they die.
Ses04M_script02_1_M019	fru	Yeah, but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives.  I mean, all that flopping around is laying eggs or what do you -- spawning or mating, something like that.
Ses04M_script02_1_M020	exc	There's mystery here and magic.
Ses04M_script02_1_F014	neu	What are you so excited about?
Ses04M_script02_1_M021	exc	Oh, it's a big night for these guys.  Uh, life's last orgy.
Ses04M_script02_1_F015	fru	This isn't a moon landing we're talking about.  It's fish.  It's fish nobody even eats.
Ses04M_script02_1_M022	exc	Yeah, they do. Okay.  But it's fish who do something none of the other fish do; like the swallows are returning to Capistrano; or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs, like that.
Ses04M_script02_1_M023	exc	There's mystery here and magic; a little bit of the unexplainable.  I don't see how you can not be interested.
Ses04M_script02_1_F016	fru	I'm just not.
Ses04M_script02_1_F017	ang	Yes.
Ses04M_script02_1_F018	ang	Last year, you will also remember, our shoes got wet.  I got sand in my panties.  We got into a big fight over nothing.  You got a sore throat and we did not see the grunions.
Ses04M_script02_1_F019	fru	We didn't see them the first time either.
Ses04M_script02_1_M028	exc	no, it's just seaweed, isn't it?  Oh, man, this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  I mean, think about this.  I know you're not interested, but just think about this for a minute.
Ses04M_script02_1_M029	exc	Out there someplace is this huge mass of silver fish heading this way.  They don't know why.  We don't know why.  It wasn't a decision.  They didn't take a vote.  No one sent them an invitation or a map;
Ses04M_script02_1_M030	exc	just some little instinctual time release firecracker went off in their little bodies and all as one, they turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.
Ses04M_script02_1_M031	exc	They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters.  It's single mindedness with no mind.  Urgency that's pure urge.
Ses04M_script02_1_M032	exc	They don't know what drives them.  They don't give it a name or ask a question.  They just turn, as one, and start the swim that brings them here; to this place, where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death.  Oh, man, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  All my hairs are popping up.
Ses04M_script02_1_F020	fru	That's the wind.
Ses04M_script02_1_M033	exc	Well so what did you think?
Ses04M_script02_2_F000	neu	Look at this, goose bumps.
Ses04M_script02_2_M000	neu	Well so what'd you think?
Ses04M_script02_2_M001	neu	What I said.
Ses04M_script02_2_M002	fru	Certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.
Ses04M_script02_2_M005	fru	Carla, can I ask you something?  Don't take this the wrong way, but are you having your period?
Ses04M_script02_2_F006	ang	Goddamn it, Augie, don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  You always ask me that.  It's insulting.
Ses04M_script02_2_M006	ang	Well what's bugging you?
Ses04M_script02_2_F007	ang	We just have different ideas about what this evening is supposed to look like.
Ses04M_script02_2_M007	ang	There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunions arrive.  They do their little fish business.  We go ooh, ah, look at the fish.  They go home.  We go home.
Ses04M_script02_2_F009	ang	We never do, do we?  Have we ever?
Ses04M_script02_2_F010	fru	Twice is every time we've tried.  That's ever.
Ses04M_script02_2_M011	fru	We'll see them this year.
Ses04M_script02_2_F012	fru	You don't have any idea what I'm saying.
Ses04M_script02_2_M013	fru	No, of course, not.
Ses04M_script02_2_F013	ang	I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking this time will be the time, but it never is.
Ses04M_script02_2_M014	fru	It's just fish; nothing to get traumatized over.
Ses04M_script02_2_M015	fru	I've been trying to work this backwards, but I can't seem to pinpoint the moment when we took a turn for the worse.
Ses04M_script02_2_M016	fru	You were fine during the phone call from Marge.  Dinner was okay.  Doing the dishes was no problem.  Let's see, I took a shower.  Uh, you watched the news.  You said the grunions are running tonight.  I said great, let's go.  I feel lucky tonight.
Ses04M_script02_2_M017	fru	Uh,okay.  So I'm putting on my jacket; putting out the animals;
Ses04M_script02_2_M018	fru	uh, taking the car out of the gara- out of the garage.
Ses04M_script02_2_M019	fru	Uh.
Ses04M_script02_2_F016	sad	It was about four years ago, right after we got married.  We thought I was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  So we took off our shoes and you popped the cork.
Ses04M_script02_2_M020	neu	Wait a minute, I've got it.
Ses04M_script02_2_F018	sad	Dancing barefoot in the sand; drinking champagne from the bottle.
Ses04M_script02_2_M021	neu	It was in the car, right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker?  You said let's get some champagne and I said times a wasting or something like that.  Right?  That's it, right?  You want this to be like the other time.  That's it.  Of course.
Ses04M_script02_2_F019	sad	I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things.
Ses04M_script02_2_F020	sad	No.
Ses04M_script02_2_F021	sad	No.
Ses04M_script02_2_M024	fru	What, you want me to breathe in your ear?
Ses04M_script02_2_F022	fru	No.
Ses04M_script02_2_M025	fru	You want to get married again?
Ses04M_script02_2_F023	fru	No.
Ses04M_script02_2_M026	fru	What, you want a divorce?
Ses04M_script02_2_F024	fru	No.
Ses04M_script02_2_M027	fru	A vacation?
Ses04M_script02_2_F025	ang	No.
Ses04M_script02_2_F026	ang	I want something to turn out the way it's supposed to.
Ses04M_script02_2_M029	ang	Well welcome to the human race.  You think this is what I had in mind?  You think that when I proposed, I had this great fantasy going that four years down the line, we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish?  No.
Ses04M_script02_2_M031	ang	And we'll have three fat rosy kids and ha, ha, ha, baby, the joke's on us, 'cause you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This.
Ses04M_script02_2_F027	ang	This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.
Ses04M_script02_2_M032	fru	Yes, it is.
Ses04M_script02_2_F028	ang	Oh, right, sure.  This is standing on the beach.   This is waiting.  This is fighting.
Ses04M_script02_2_M033	fru	Right.
Ses04M_script02_2_F029	ang	But this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.
Ses04M_script02_2_M034	ang	No, I know, me neither.
Ses04M_script02_2_M035	fru	I'm doing the best I can.
Ses04M_script02_2_F031	fru	I know you are, Augie.  Really, I do.  I know you meant for this to be special and nice and it's the full moon and the sand and everything.  But I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.
Ses04M_script02_2_F032	sad	I didn't say that.
Ses04M_script02_2_M037	sad	No, I know.  But still.  I know I don't make you happy.
Ses04M_script02_2_M039	hap	Actually, now that you mention it, no.  I don't.
Ses04M_script02_2_F035	hap	Okay, fine.  So we're in the wrong spot, but we're with the right person.
Ses04M_script02_2_M040	hap	I don't know.  It seemed like a good spot to me.  I mean, look at the view you've got of the moon from here.
Ses04M_script02_2_F036	hap	Yeah, I noticed that.  Looks pretty on the water, doesn't it?  Big ol' white moon.  I'm sorry, Augie.
Ses04M_script02_2_M041	hap	Shh.  If we're very quiet, the fish might come.
Ses04M_script03_1_M003	neu	We'll be alright, darling.  Whatever happens, aren't we?
Ses04M_script03_1_M004	exc	I don't care, then.
Ses04M_script03_1_F005	exc	Oh, it sent shivers up my spine.
Ses04M_script03_1_M006	exc	What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us?
Ses04M_script03_1_F006	exc	Behave exquisitely.
Ses04M_script03_1_M007	exc	With the mo- with the most perfect poise?
Ses04M_script03_1_F007	exc	Certainly.  I shall probably do a court curtsey.
Ses04M_script03_1_F008	exc	But what's so horrible is that one can't stay happy.
Ses04M_script03_1_F009	exc	It's true.  The whole business is a very poor joke.
Ses04M_script03_1_M010	neu	Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing, love?
Ses04M_script03_1_M012	neu	You mustn't be serious, my dear.  That's just what they want.
Ses04M_script03_1_F012	exc	Who's they?
Ses04M_script03_1_M013	ang	All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything.  All their sacred shibboleths.  Flippancy brings out the acid- acid in their damn sweetness and light.
Ses04M_script03_1_F013	neu	If I laugh at everything, I must laugh at us, too.
Ses04M_script03_1_F014	exc	How long will it last, this ludicrous and overbearing love of ours?
Ses04M_script03_1_F015	exc	Shall we always want to bicker and fight?
Ses04M_script03_1_M016	sad	No.  That fire will fade along with our passion.
Ses04M_script03_1_F017	exc	What happens if one of us dies?  Does the one that's left, still laugh?
Ses04M_script03_1_F018	exc	Well that's serious enough, isn't it?
Ses04M_script03_1_M021	exc	Let's savor the delight of the moment.  Come and kiss me, darling, before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.
Ses04M_script03_1_F021	exc	Thank you, dear.  The same applies to you, except that if I catch you so much as looking at another woman, I will kill you.
Ses04M_script03_1_F022	exc	Which particular one?
Ses04M_script03_1_F023	exc	Oh, Charles; that was his name, Charles.  Oh, he did wriggle so beautifully.
Ses04M_script03_1_M025	ang	Horrible thing.  I hated it.
Ses04M_script03_1_F024	exc	I know you did.  You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.
Ses04M_script03_1_F025	exc	It went on intermittently for days.
Ses04M_script03_1_F026	exc	It burnt my comb, too, and all the towels in the bathroom.
Ses04M_script03_1_M028	neu	Line?
Ses04M_script03_1_M029	exc	How -- that was a rouser wasn't it?
Ses04M_script03_1_F027	exc	That was the first time you ever hit me.
Ses04M_script03_1_F028	exc	The manager came in and found is rolling about on the floor, biting and scratching like panthers.  Oh, dear.
Ses04M_script03_1_F029	exc	How ridiculous. How utterly, utterly ridiculous.
Ses04M_script03_1_F030	exc	And very much sillier.
Ses04M_script03_1_M033	neu	As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.
Ses04M_script03_2_F000	ang	That was the first time you ever hit me.
Ses04M_script03_2_M001	neu	I didn't hit you very hard.
Ses04M_script03_2_F001	hap	The manager came in and found us rolling about on the floor, biting and scratching like panthers.  Oh, dear.
Ses04M_script03_2_F002	hap	How ridiculous.  How utterly, utterly ridiculous.
Ses04M_script03_2_F003	hap	And very much sillier.
Ses04M_script03_2_M004	fru	As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.
Ses04M_script03_2_M005	fru	I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.
Ses04M_script03_2_F006	exc	Not at all.  It was very pretty.  I still have it and I wear it often.
Ses04M_script03_2_M007	fru	You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.
Ses04M_script03_2_M008	ang	You must admit that he was in love with you, wasn't he?
Ses04M_script03_2_F008	hap	Just a little, perhaps, nothing serious.
Ses04M_script03_2_M009	neu	Line?
Ses04M_script03_2_F009	neu	Let him kiss you.
Ses04M_script03_2_M010	ang	You let him kiss you.  You said you did.
Ses04M_script03_2_F010	ang	What of it?
Ses04M_script03_2_M011	ang	What of it?
Ses04M_script03_2_M012	ang	What about me?
Ses04M_script03_2_F012	fru	If you hadn't been so nosey, you never would have known a thing about it.
Ses04M_script03_2_M013	ang	That's a nice point of view, I must say.
Ses04M_script03_2_F013	fru	Oh, dear.  I'm bored with this conversation.
Ses04M_script03_2_M014	ang	So am I; bored stiff.
Ses04M_script03_2_F014	ang	No, thanks.
Ses04M_script03_2_M016	fru	I'll have a little myself, I think.
Ses04M_script03_2_F015	fru	I don't see why you want it.  You've already had two glasses.
Ses04M_script03_2_M017	fru	No particular reason.  Anyhow, they were very small ones.
Ses04M_script03_2_F016	fru	It seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.
Ses04M_script03_2_M018	fru	You can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on.
Ses04M_script03_2_F017	ang	It's become a habit with you.
Ses04M_script03_2_M019	fru	You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want any at the moment.
Ses04M_script03_2_F018	fru	Oh, don't be so stupid.
Ses04M_script03_2_M020	ang	Really, Amanda
Ses04M_script03_2_F019	ang	What?
Ses04M_script03_2_M021	ang	Nothing.
Ses04M_script03_2_M022	ang	Going out somewhere, my dear?
Ses04M_script03_2_F020	fru	No, just making myself fascinating for you
Ses04M_script03_2_M023	fru	Oh.  That reply has broken my heart.
Ses04M_script03_2_M024	ang	As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true.
Ses04M_script03_2_F022	ang	Oh, no, it isn't.
Ses04M_script03_2_M025	ang	Yes, it is.
Ses04M_script03_2_F023	ang	Oh, be quiet.
Ses04M_script03_2_M026	neu	Line?
Ses04M_script03_2_F024	neu	It's a pity you didn't- It's a pity you didn't have more brandy.
Ses04M_script03_2_M027	ang	It's a pity you didn't have any more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.
Ses04M_script03_2_F025	fru	It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.
Ses04M_script03_2_M028	neu	Line?
Ses04M_script03_2_M029	ang	Snap.  Oh, snap, snap, snap, like a little adder.
Ses04M_script03_2_F026	ang	Adders don't snap, they sting.
Ses04M_script03_2_M030	ang	They -- nonsense, they have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.
Ses04M_script03_2_F027	fru	They sting.
Ses04M_script03_2_M031	ang	They snap.
Ses04M_script03_2_F028	ang	I don't care.  Do you understand?  I don't care.  I don't mind if they bark and roll about like hoops.
Ses04M_script03_2_F029	ang	Yes, I did, quite a lot.
Ses04M_script03_2_M033	ang	I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then, hmm?
Ses04M_script03_2_F030	ang	Mind your own business.
Ses04M_script03_2_M034	ang	You must have had a riotous time.
Ses04M_script03_2_M035	ang	No restraint at all, very enjoyable.  You never had much anyhow.
Ses04M_script03_2_F031	ang	You're quite insufferable.  I expected it's because you're drunk.
Ses04M_script03_2_M036	ang	I'm not in the least drunk.
Ses04M_script03_2_F032	ang	You always had a weak head.
Ses04M_script03_2_M037	fru	I think I mentioned once before that I've only had three minute liquor glasses of brandy this whole evening.  That's hardly enough to get a child of two drunk.
Ses04M_script03_2_F033	ang	On the contrary, a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.
Ses04M_script03_2_M038	ang	Very interesting.  And how about a child of four and a child of six and a child of nine?
Ses04M_script03_2_F034	ang	Oh, shut up.
Ses04M_script03_2_F035	ang	Not very funny, dear.  You'd better have some more brandy.
Ses04M_script03_2_M040	ang	Very good idea.  I will
Ses04M_script03_2_M041	ang	You better turn that off I think.
Ses04M_script03_2_F036	ang	Why?
Ses04M_script03_2_F037	ang	There aren't any people upstairs.  It's a photographer's studio.
Ses04M_script03_2_M043	ang	There are people downstairs, I suppose
Ses04M_script03_2_F039	ang	Turn it on again, please.
Ses04M_script03_2_F040	ang	Very well, if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.
Ses04M_script03_2_M046	ang	Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.
Ses04M_script03_2_F041	ang	Go away.  Go away.  I hate you.
Ses04M_script03_2_M047	ang	Turn it off.
Ses04M_script03_2_F042	ang	You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.
Ses04M_script03_2_F043	neu	We swapped. Listen.
Ses04M_script03_2_M048	ang	Listen--
Ses04M_script03_2_F044	ang	Listen, indeed.  I am sick and tired of listening to you, you damn sadistic bully.
Ses04M_script03_2_M049	ang	You're a vile tempered, loosed living
Ses04M_script03_2_F045	ang	Stop.
Ses04M_script03_2_M050	ang	wicked little beast. And I- I hope I never see you again as long as live.
Ses04M_script03_2_F046	ang	Stop.  I hate you.  Do you hear me? You're conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.
Ses04M_script03_2_F047	ang	This is the end.  Do you understand, the end?  Finally and forever.
Ses04M_script03_2_M051	ang	You're not going like this.
Ses04M_script03_2_F048	ang	Oh, yes, I am.
Ses04M_script03_2_M052	ang	No, you're not.
Ses04M_script03_2_F049	ang	Let go of me.  You're a cruel fiend and I hate and loath you.  Thank God, I discovered in time what you're really like.
Ses04M_script03_2_M053	ang	Shut up. Shut up.
Ses04M_script03_2_M054	ang	You're a mean, evil minded
Ses04M_script03_2_F050	ang	Marry you again? Huh.
Ses04M_script03_2_M055	ang	little vampire And I hope to God I never set eyes on you as long as I live.
Ses04M_script03_2_F051	ang	Never, never, never.  I'd rather die in torment. Beast brute.
Ses04M_script03_2_M056	ang	Whore.
Ses04M_script03_2_F052	ang	Swine.
